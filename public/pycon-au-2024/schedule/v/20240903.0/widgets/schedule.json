Causal discovery means learning \"what causes what\" from your data. The input is a tabular dataset; the output is a causal graphical model (or a set of potential models) over your features. If feature A affects feature B, there should be an arrow A-->B in the causal graphical model. Causal discovery is useful for hypothesis generation, experiment selection, and for testing our assumptions around causation.\r\n\r\nI'll give a brief intro to causal discovery, then review the following packages: py-tetrad, causal-learn, tigramite, causalnex, and cdt (causal discovery toolbox). The packages have some overlap but different emphases: each one implements at least one algorithm not covered by the other packages, making them useful in different situations.

There are many situations where these scores are insufficient for assessing correctness, accuracy or suitability of a model or prediction. The challenge of verifying models and predictions affects most fields of science, engineering, and many machine learning applications.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce \"scores\", an open source Python package for verifying and evaluating labelled, n-dimensional (multidimensional) data at any scale. \"scores\" includes over 50 metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools. The software repository can be found at https://github.com/nci/scores and the documentation can be found at https://scores.readthedocs.io/ .\r\n\r\nThis talk is suitable for beginner, intermediate and expert audiences. Developers and data scientists who are familiar mainly with tabular data, such as supported by the pandas library, may be interested in the additional functionality offered by \"scores\" (and the xarray library it utilises).

Applications are broad, and include recognition via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), textual restoration, palaeographic analysis, topic modelling, representation learning, decipherment and machine translation (Sommerschield 2023). A large number of ancient language corpora have been digitised in recent decades, supporting this research. However, while the necessary Unicode blocks for many of these ancient scripts are available, a number of these data sets are still presented as Romanised transliterations.\r\n\r\nIn response to this situation, we have created Potnia (https://pypi.org/project/potnia/), an open-source Python language library under the Apache 2.0 license, designed to convert such transliterated texts to Unicode. The session image accompanying this proposal provides an example of Potnia\u2019s conversion process, with a Romanised transliteration of a Linear B text as the input, and the Unicode representation of this same text as the output. This conversion is crucial for downstream machine learning tasks, as tokenisation in the original Unicode script allows for more accurate representation of linguistic structures and mitigates potential biases introduced by transliteration.\r\n\r\nPotnia's flexible architecture, built on Python's object-oriented principles, employs string manipulation techniques and regular expressions to handle various complexities inherent in ancient texts, such as uncertain readings, missing elements, and script-specific notations. At present, the library can be used for Linear B texts, with functionality for Linear A, Sumerian and Akkadian soon to follow.\r\n\r\nPotnia's design allows for easy addition of new scripts, each with its own set of rules for tokenisation, regularisation, and character mapping. This extensibility positions us well for future inclusion of additional scripts. To ensure reliability and facilitate open-source contributions, we've implemented a comprehensive test suite using pytest, with test cases defined in YAML files for easy expansion. This approach covers key functionalities across different scripts and simplifies the process of adding new test scenarios as the library grows.\r\n\r\n<b><em>References</em></b>\r\nSommerschield, T., Y.

Today, we\u2019ll turn our attention to the railways as we take 20 years of hindsight to look at the \u2018Broady runaway\u2019 and what it can teach us. This talk will dive into the ATSB\u2019s subsequent safety investigation, recommendations and parallels in the software world, offering us critical lessons in complex system design and incident management.\r\n\r\nFor software engineers, architects, managers and executives this is an opportunity for us to reflect and learn from the past so that we can build more resilient and easier to operate platforms in the future.\r\n\r\nOur runaway train is a 3 car electrical multiple unit (EMU) that, in 2003, did the full 17km Broadmeadows to Spencer st run in just 16 minutes, famously without a driver on board. The cause of the runaway and resulting collision with a stationary diesel locomotive has been the talk of many rail enthusiasts ever since, especially since there were no fatalities or serious injuries.", "speakers": ["PB9BKD"], "track": 4870, "start": "2024-11-23T14:50:00+11:00", "end": "2024-11-23T15:20:00+11:00", "room": 3410, "duration": 30, "updated": "2024-08-14T08:51:32.251350+00:00", "state": null, "do_not_record": false}, {"id": 1060914, "title": {"en": "Afternoon break"}, "start": "2024-11-23T04:20:00Z", "end": "2024-11-23T15:50:00+11:00", "room": 3410}, {"id": 1060916, "title": {"en": "Afternoon break"}, "start": "2024-11-23T04:20:00Z", "end": "2024-11-23T15:50:00+11:00", "room": 3412}, {"id": 1060915, "title": {"en": "Afternoon break"}, "start": "2024-11-23T04:20:00Z", "end": "2024-11-23T15:50:00+11:00", "room": 3411}, {"id": 1061283, "title": {"en": "Lightning Talks (Saturday)"}, "start": "2024-11-23T04:50:00Z", "end": "2024-11-23T16:50:00+11:00", "room": 3410}, {"id": 1061284, "title": {"en": "Conference Opening (Sunday)"}, "start": "2024-11-23T22:00:00Z", "end": "2024-11-24T09:20:00+11:00", "room": 3410}, {"id": 1061285, "title": {"en": "[placeholder] Keynote (Sunday)"}, "start": "2024-11-23T22:20:00Z", "end": "2024-11-24T10:05:00+11:00", "room": 3410}, {"id": 1061273, "title": {"en": "Morning break"}, "start": "2024-11-23T23:05:00Z", "end": "2024-11-24T10:35:00+11:00", "room": 3410}, {"id": 1061274, "title": {"en": "Morning break"}, "start": "2024-11-23T23:05:00Z", "end": "2024-11-24T10:35:00+11:00", "room": 3412}, {"id": 1061271, "title": {"en": "Morning break"}, "start": "2024-11-23T23:05:00Z", "end": "2024-11-24T10:35:00+11:00", "room": 3411}, {"code": "QTWAGZ", "id": 1061371, "title": "Better dataframes", "abstract": "Dataframes are an abstraction that proven extremely useful for data analysis in dynamic languages like S, R, Python, and Julia.
