    <h1>Development Sprints</h1>
  
      <p>
        Sprints run on both Monday &amp; Tuesday in the Junior Ballroom.
      </p>
    <p>
      Python wouldn’t have gotten to where it is without a welcoming community
      of developers building cool things together. The development sprints are
      an open space for people to work on projects with a particular focus on
      open source projects.
    </p><p>
      The sprints are a place for everyone, from experienced open source
      contributors, to interested first-time contributors, and anyone really!
      Maybe you want to hang out and try out an idea you have, maybe you’d like
      to find collaborators for a project you want to start, maybe you’d like
      someone to help you through your first attempts at open source. We’ll
      provide tables, chairs, wifi, power and a community of supportive
      developers.
