abstract: "<p>Data science projects occupy an unsual space between coding/hacking
  and methodologically rigorous experimentation. They require careful discipline to
  prevent problems like target leakage, over-fitting or p-hacking. Typically, data
  scientists use custom workflows, or proprietary cloud systems to automate and standardise
  certain elements like management of data sets, scripts, model artefacts and results.
  The result is a general absence of both standardisation and easy migration of processes
  for flexible and repeatable data science work.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will outline
  a light weight open source python package that can be used to manage project meta-data
  in a way that allows easy sharing, migration and collaboration for data scientists
  working in the python ecosystem. We will discuss some of the design principles,
  inspired by a combination of the UNIX command line and the git source control utility.
  We will then demonstrate basic usage of the package with examples from scientific
  research papers it has been used for.</p>\n<p>https://pypi.org/project/projit/</p>"
