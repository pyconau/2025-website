abstract: <p>Beginner programmers often struggle to understand and trace program execution,
  which is worsened by underdeveloped debugging and testing skills. Beginners may
  also lack confidence or are easily demotivated, which can hinder learning. To assist
  students in developing these skills and build confidence we created a set of playful
  programming challenges and competition using Karel the Robot. The Karel system provides
  a 2D “grid world” where the Karel character can move and interact with its environment.
  The 2D world is visualised for students so that they can immediately see how their
  program changes the environment step by step as well as the final program state.
  This is in contrast to traditional languages where learners must develop and maintain
  a mental model of the program state. This talk will cover our approach, preliminary
  results and feedback from students showing an increase in confidence and interest
  in programming. We will also share how this approach can be applied to other learning
  contexts.</p>

  of playful programming challenges and competition using Karel the Robot.</p>\n<p>Karel
  the Robot was developed at Stanford to help students learn programming concepts
  without the burden of syntax and technicalities of a more general language. Karel
  provides a 2D ‘grid world’ where the Karel character can move and interact with
  the environment to carry out various tasks, e.g. walk through a maze. This gives
  students the opportunity for playful experimentation with code, which helps develop
  their understanding of programming concepts. Furthermore the 2D world is visualised
  for students so that they can immediately see how their program changes the environment
  step by step as well as the final program state. Karel makes the code tangible to
  the students, which  is in contrast to traditional languages where learners must
  develop and maintain a mental model of the program state.</p>\n<p>Fortunately Karel
  uses a subset of Python, which allows students to naturally extend their learning
  to real Python, without learning new syntax. We found that Karel provides a convenient
  way to implement inductive teaching, which has been shown to enhance student's higher
  order thinking abilities and strengthen their understanding of concepts when compared
  to deductive teaching.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover our approach, preliminary results
  and feedback from students showing an increase in confidence and interest in programming.
  We will also share how this approach can be applied to other learning contexts.</p>"
