abstract: "<p>We’re all building AI features now – or will be soon. But working with
  teams who are building with LLMs brings its own challenges – namely: How can we
  bring in the latest research, consider AI ethics, and consider the cost of different
  models without blowing past delivery dates. Not to mention making sure that the
  features we build will be stable, reliable, and maintainable in the future. </p>\n
  <p>In this talk, I’ll share a case study of how we built our first LLM feature.
  In 1 month, we did everything from running experiments, developing evaluation methods,
  assessing the risks, and considering ethical concerns to build the feature. Specifically,
  over this period we did a literature review, consultation with academic experts,
  data labelling, model experimentation, a cost assessment, and finally, all the ML
  engineering to launch it into production. The outcome: &lt;1% extreme misclassification
  and zero hallucinations.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll share our approach to building
  LLM features – how we partnered with academia (without being delayed by their timelines),
  what tooling we used, and how we made the cost and money tradeoffs to keep business
  stakeholders happy. As one example, we’ll share how important evaluation data was
  for building our features, because it helped us improve our definitions and revealed
  gender differences in how people perceive feedback. We’ll share the principles we
  used when balancing rigorous, robust practices with cost and timeline considerations.
  Finally, we’ll share which frameworks actually helped us make the right calls, avoid
  expensive do-overs, and navigate the AI ethics side as well.\nYou'll walk away with
  hands-on tools for leading the AI conversation within your own organization – including
  how to identify ethical issues early, address them efficiently, and still deliver
  on time and on budget.</p>"
