abstract: "<p>You're probably familiar with Mozilla's Common Voice project - a crowd-sourced,
  collective effort that's provided speech data in over 300 languages to help democratise
  voice technologies and make speech recognition work better for more people.</p>\n
  <p>Now, we're delighted to introduce a sister platform to Common Voice - the <a
  href=\"https://datacollective.mozillafoundation.org\">Mozilla Data Collective</a>.
  </p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>AI has a data crisis. We're running out of quality
  training data because the entire web has already been harvested by crawlers to train
  AI models  — leading to the \"Token Crisis\". What’s left? Synthetic data generated
  en masse - that’s bland, generic and unrepresentative of the world’s diversity.
  This data is also problematic for training models, as it can lead to model collapse.
  Meanwhile, quality datasets from diverse contributors sit unused in silos.</p>\n
  <h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Mozilla Data Collective is a platform in the truest sense.
  It’s yours to stand on, and make of it what you will. Mozilla Data Collective works
  by allowing you to share your data, retain ownership of it, and control who uses
  it. Upload datasets from research, community collections or specialised corpora.
  Set your terms - who uses it, for what purpose, and what you get in return. Keep
  control by tracking who’s using your datasets. </p>\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\n<p>Our
  vision is to encourage the creation of safe, responsible AI that works for <em>everyone</em>
  - by helping communities to share authentic, ethical and diverse data - a stark
  contrast to models built by indiscriminately scraping the web and reproducing or
  synthesising its Anglocentric, white, male biases.</p>\n<p>We want people and organisations
  - like you - to be able to create, curate and control your data, rather than have
  it harvested and scraped without your knowledge or consent.</p>\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n
  <p>Join Kathy Reid as she walks you through why better AI requires better data -
  and why better data requires collective, collaborative, co-created approaches: Mozilla
  Data Collective.</p>"
