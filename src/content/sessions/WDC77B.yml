abstract: "<p>Long ago when deep learning was all the rage (circa 2018), you could
  spend a lot of time and money crunching a lot of data to make a new model and come
  up with something that was … inconclusively better than what you had had before.
  Was your model architecture wrong? Could you have picked a better learning rate?
  Stuck in a local optimum? How to know? </p>\n<p>The best way out of the swamp of
  confusion was to know what you were shooting for. What was a reasonable limit for
  how good an answer you could get? So we built benchmarks.  Unfortunately, a lot
  of teams working with both traditional and generative AI techniques today aren’t
  using realistic benchmarks to draw a line in the sand and say ‘we’re aiming for
  this’. </p>\n<p>Let's take a look at why you don't, why you should and how to go
  about it.</p>"
