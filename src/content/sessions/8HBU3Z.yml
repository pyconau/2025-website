abstract: "<p>Over six years ago, three engineers from Sydney started working on an
  insurtech platform with global ambitions. They chose Django, even though two of
  them had no prior experience with the framework. Nevertheless, the project became
  a success, affirming that choosing Django was a great technical decision.</p>\n
  <p>This is a real-life story about the challenges the team faced while scaling the
  project and changing the database architecture, all while maintaining uninterrupted
  services for millions of customers. We will cover some of the key technical decisions
  the team made, how Django supported us in migrating from a single database to a
  multi-database architecture, and examine the architectural benefits of using multiple
  databases in data-intensive applications.</p>"
