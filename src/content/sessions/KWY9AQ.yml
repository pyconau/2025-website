abstract: "<p>In this presentation, we will demonstrate how we use Python as a bridge
  to facilitate a live music concert. Using computer vision techniques with libraries
  such as OpenCV and MediaPipe, we detect various animal plushies – including koalas,
  whales, otters, octopuses, and Blåhaj – each mapped to their own unique sonic identities.
  </p>\n<p>The position and movement of these plushies in space are tracked to control
  sound parameters such as panning, pitch, reverb level, and tempo modulation, thereby
  creating a playful, gesture-based system for musical expression, blending tangible
  interaction with digital sound synthesis. </p>\n<p>We will walk through how we’ve
  applied Python for both networking (via OSC) and computer vision, and share why
  Python’s readability and strong ecosystem made it the perfect fit for fast prototyping
  and real-time control. We’ll also touch on our creative process, including mapping
  physical toys to digital instruments, and ensuring smooth, latency-free performance.
  </p>\n<p>The presentation will close with a five-minute interactive concert, where
  the audience will experience how plushie placement and movement generate evolving
  soundscapes in real time. We hope to inspire others to explore Python as a tool
  not just for logic and data, but also for creative expression.</p>"
