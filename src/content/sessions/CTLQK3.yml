abstract: <p>How do you lead digital transformation when your starting point is paper,
  pens, and a patchwork of spreadsheets? In this session, I share how business users
  helped drive real change at one of Australia’s largest food and hospitality service
  providers—progressing from manual paperwork to a cloud-native platform powered by
  Python, Django, Docker, and Kubernetes.</p>
description: "<p>I’ll take you behind the scenes of digital transformation in a traditional,
  paper-heavy business—sharing first-hand experiences from those who faced the frustrations
  and became part of the solution. Along the way, I’ll highlight real initiatives
  delivered: from early automation with spreadsheets and scripts, to building a scalable,
  modern platform.</p>\n<p>Rather than a technical deep dive, this talk offers an
  honest look at what it takes to modernise operations in a non-tech environment—while
  always focusing on people, process, and platform.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a developer
  in a traditional industry or someone championing transformation from within, you’ll
  find this story relatable, candid, and maybe even a little fun.</p>"
