abstract: <p>Discover how non-IT employees led a digital transformation at one of
  Australia’s leading food and hospitality service providers—progressing from paper
  forms to spreadsheets, then from no-code tools to a full-stack platform built with
  Python, Django, Docker, and Kubernetes. Told from the perspective of insiders directly
  involved in the change, this talk shares the stories behind key transformation initiatives,
  their challenges, and how we navigated them.</p>
description: "<p>This talk shares the journey of digital transformation in a traditional,
  paper-heavy business—told by those who experienced the frustration firsthand and
  then became part of the solution.</p>\n<p>We’ll take you through several real initiatives
  we helped deliver, from early automation efforts using spreadsheets and scripts,
  to building a scalable cloud-native platform.</p>\n<p>This is not a technical deep
  dive — it's a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to modernise operations in
  a non-tech environment, while staying grounded in doing the right thing for people,
  process, and platform.</p>\n<p>Whether you're a developer working in a traditional
  industry or someone trying to push transformation from the inside, this story will
  be relatable, honest, and maybe even a little fun.</p>"
