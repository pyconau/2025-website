abstract: <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI
  assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business
  tools, and development environments. This talk explores practical implementation
  patterns for building robust MCP servers in Python, covering architecture decisions,
  error handling strategies, and real-world deployment considerations. You'll learn
  to move beyond basic examples to production-grade implementations that can reliably
  serve AI applications at scale.</p>
description: "<p>MCP represents a paradigm shift in how AI applications access external
  data and tools. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C
  provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories,
  MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and
  tools.\nThis session will cover:\n- Foundation &amp; Architecture (8 minutes)\n
  - Implementation Patterns (12 minutes)\n- Production Considerations (5 minutes)\n
  - Live Demo (5 minutes)</p>"
