abstract: "<p>Object-oriented programming can feel impossibly abstract to students,
  and demoralising to the teacher facing a class of blank stares, until you bring
  in Pikachu. This presentation shows how Pokemon naturally demonstrates every OOP
  concept we might struggle to teach, from basic classes to inheritance.</p>\n<p>Instead
  of the standard \"Car\" and \"Animal\" examples, students work through boiler plate
  code to predict, debug and eventually create classes and objects, to design and
  build battle systems. </p>\n<p>You'll see student work samples, and walk away with
  some different ideas on approaching teaching with OOP.</p>"
