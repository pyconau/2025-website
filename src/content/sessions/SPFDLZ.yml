abstract: <p>The cyber threat landscape is vast, deep and ever-changing. Short of
  retraining as cybersecurity professionals, How can we, as python developers do our
  part to help keep ourselves, our customers and our data safe? In this talk, we'll
  look at the current threat landscape, the ways developers commonly fall short, and
  just how simple it can be to drastically reduce the "oops factor" of our Python
  development lifecycle.</p>
description: "<p>Extremely clear, practical and easily actionable advice for how everyday
  Python developers can improve the security posture of their projects today.</p>\n\
  <p>We'll step through common risk factors, looking at examples of high profile failures
  including: credential leakage, PyPI and supply chain security and how SAST (static
  analysis security testing) can help identify common bugs - many of which have been
  on the OWASP top 10 since the very beginning.</p>\n<p>As we go, we'll build up our
  own swiss-cheese model of risks and explore Python tooling that we can add to our
  DevSecOps pipeline to improve our security posture.</p>\n<p>The key takeaways is
  just how easily we can all score some easy wins with little effort.</p>"
