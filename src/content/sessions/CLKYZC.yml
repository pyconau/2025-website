abstract: "<p>Free form data entry is a realm that is simply begging for data that
  you’ll never be able to crossmatch. Whether it’s typos, using obscure initialisations,
  or deciding that “name” sometimes means “full name” and sometimes means “nickname
  of the day” your data is never going to be a perfect match. And let me tell you,
  those problems are multiplied if some of that data is entered by children!</p>\n
  <p>I’ll take you through the techniques from edit distance to generative AI (and
  combinations thereof) I have used to match up proper nouns ranging from people’s
  names to schools and see how some techniques work for people and not for places,
  and vice versa. I’ll show you how it is working in practice to help track event
  participants over the course of a single workshop day and ultimately over the course
  of their journey through our community.</p>"
description: "<p>I have a problem. I have masses of free-form textual data that captures
  the participation of members of a community in our events over many, many years!
  This data includes things like student names, school names, and other proper nouns
  – things that might have many interpretations of a “correct” answer or “good enough”
  answer, and things that kids and their parents certainly have different thoughts
  on. </p>\n<p>I needed to get to the bottom of fuzzy matching of proper nouns and
  to work out what combinations of different algorithmic and AI techniques worked
  best for different types of nouns. So come with me on this journey of typos, nicknames,
  and how this non-Sydney-schooled Pythonista was able to figure out which schools
  “Spats”, “Tech”, and “Cathedral” actually were.</p>"
