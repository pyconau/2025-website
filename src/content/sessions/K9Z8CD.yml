abstract: "<p>Every software system can benefit from being \"faster\". </p>\n<p>But
  what does “faster” mean, exactly? How do we get to “faster”? If everyone is trying
  to build performant systems, then why are so many of them <em>so slow</em>? </p>\n\
  <p>Let's talk about the fundamentals of performance engineering, and how to use
  them design and build systems that feel \"faster\" - even when that's not quite
  what you thought.</p>"
description: "<p>This talk will examine the fundamentals of performance engineering
  and optimisation: </p>\n<p>•   What do we mean by “faster”, or “performant”? Why
  do they mean different things to different people? </p>\n<p>•   What core trade-offs
  do we make (consciously or unconsciously) when designing and optimising systems?
  Why do systems feel slow? Are the engineers just bad, or are there potentially good
  reasons?</p>\n<p>•   How do we tell what’s important? How can we tell when we’ve
  done enough? What are the conversations we can have as a team at the start of a
  project that will save us pain down the line?</p>\n<p>•   Which core principles
  of computing do you need to understand to write fast and efficient code?</p>\n<p>•\
  \   How can we access those concepts from Python?</p>\n<p>We’ll use Python-based
  examples to demonstrate these concepts, and you’ll also learn about some of the
  improvements that have been made in recent PEPs and Python releases, which make
  it easier than ever to write performant code. </p>\n<p>While this talk is primarily
  drawn from experience building data processing pipelines, the concepts and principles
  of performance are universally applicable across the entire Python and software
  development ecosystem. You should attend this talk if you’re interested in designing
  and building performant software and systems, and it will contain content relevant
  to individual contributors of all levels. </p>\n<p>You’ll leave this talk with an
  improved way to discuss performance with your fellow engineers, product managers,
  project teams, and management. Not only that, but you’ll learn concrete techniques
  for making your code run faster and more efficiently, regardless of what that means
  for your team.</p>"
