abstract: <p>In this workshop, we will build a ChatBot based on Retrieval Augmented
  Generation (RAG). The ChatBot will leverage MongoDB Atlas, embedding models, Large
  Language Models (LLMs) to generate contextualized answers and textual content in
  accordance to users’ queries based on publicly available sources.</p>
description: "<p>In this hands-on workshop, attendees will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn the
  foundations of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), such as chunking, embedding,
  and semantic search</li>\n<li>Perform semantic search queries against a MongoDB
  Atlas collection </li>\n<li>Build a simple RAG system using MongoDB Atlas and open-source
  LLMs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Add memory to the RAG application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition
  to these goals, the lab also offers more advanced content that covers:</li>\n<li>Combining
  pre-filtering with vector search</li>\n<li>Adding re-ranking to the RAG application</li>\n
  <li>Stream responses from the RAG application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attendees will be
  provided with all the resources required to successfully execute the hands-on portions
  of the workshop, including a GitHub repository consisting of notebook templates
  with pseudocode. Attendees will replace the pseudocode with their own code during
  the workshop.</p>"
