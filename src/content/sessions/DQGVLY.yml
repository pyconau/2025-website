abstract: <p>After creating a great web app using Python such as with flask, the next
  hurdle to production is how to make it available to users and operate it. And not
  just your app, but also ingress, the database, observability and the list goes on.
  We will go through your options for simplifying the operations of your web app using
  open source tooling. This will include using k8s directly, helm charts, IaaC using
  pulumi and new tooling developed by Canonical using juju. By the end of the talk
  you will have seen the benefits and drawbacks of each which will help you make an
  informed decision on which tool best suits your needs!</p>
