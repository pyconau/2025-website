abstract: "<p>Sprints run on both Monday &amp; Tuesday in the Junior Ballroom.</p>\n
  <p>Python wouldn’t have gotten to where it is without a welcoming community of developers
  building cool things together. The development sprints are an open space for people
  to work on projects with a particular focus on open source projects.</p>\n<p>The
  sprints are a place for everyone, from experienced open source contributors, to
  interested first-time contributors, and anyone really! Maybe you want to hang out
  and try out an idea you have, maybe you’d like to find collaborators for a project
  you want to start, maybe you’d like someone to help you through your first attempts
  at open source. We’ll provide tables, chairs, wifi, power and a community of supportive
  developers.</p>"
