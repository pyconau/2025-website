  you... whatcha gonna do?</p>
description: <p>As a volunteer emergency responder I spend a lot of my spare time
  preparing to respond to an incident, and then putting those preparations into practice.
  But then in my work in tech I see what happens when we donâ€™t prepare to respond
  to emergency incidents. Using the core framework of all Australian emergency situations,
  we will explore the key components of an emergency, and how to best plan, prepare
  and respond.</p>
