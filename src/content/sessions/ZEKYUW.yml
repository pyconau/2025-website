abstract: <p>An introduction to writing performant Python code - the "what, why, where,
  when and many how's" of performance analysis, testing, tools and techniques.</p>
description: "<p>Why, as Python developers, should we care about writing performant
  code? Python doesn't have a great reputation when it comes to performance, but this
  does not need to be the case!\nIn this talk we will cover:\n- <b>What do you mean
  by 'Performant'?</b> We'll talk briefly about the different metrics that can measure
  the performance of software, and the history of performance in Python.\n- <b>Why,
  Where and When?</b> Performance should be an important consideration in the code
  we write and distribute, however performance analysis and improvement can be a time-consuming
  endevour, so we will look at how to identify where this time is best invested, and
  why.\n- <b>How do I start?</b> There are many tools available; libraries, IDE extensions,
  command line tools, and of course, within the Python standard library, so we will
  explore options and what benefits each provides.\n- <b>How do I find issues?</b>
  Trying to improve the performance of code is not like regular debugging - we will
  look at how to use these tools to identify problem areas in the code by looking
  through some examples.\n- <b>How do I fix it?</b> There's always more than one solution
  to a performance problem. We'll look at how our example issues could be mitigated
  and the pros and cons of varying approaches, including the use of compiled extensions.\n
  - <b>How do I know when I'm finished?</b> Is my code performant <i>enough</i>? Improving
  performance can be highly iterative, with changes yielding only minor incremental
  improvements. We will talk about some of the challenges in determining success criteria,
  and trying to cost estimate performance work.</p>\n<p>This talk will touch on some
  more advanced Python syntax, as well as peeking into how the Python language works,
  so some basic coding experience is assumed. However, the topics and techniques discussed
  will be applicable to developers of all levels.</p>\n<p>Some things we won't cover:\n
  - High-level architecture for high performance systems. This talk will mostly focus
  on lower-level code structure and syntax.\n- C/Rust extensions will not be covered
  in detail in this talk, however we will take a look at identifying when an extension
  could be a good fit to solving performance problems, and the pros and cons of this
  approach.\n- In this talk we will focus on the execution time of CPU-bound code
  as the measure of performance, so we won't discuss other performance metrics, such
  as memory usage or IO traffic.</p>"
