abstract: "<p>MicroPython continues to grow in popularity. But <em>why</em>? What
  is it about this pint-sized version of Python that makes it so darn compelling?
  What are the best bits of MicroPython? </p>\n<p>Join me in this talk for a whirlwind
  tour of some of the most exciting features of this modern embedded programming language.</p>"
description: "<p>There’s no question; C and C++ are the 800 pound gorillas of the
  embedded domain. But MicroPython provides a high-level language alternative in this
  space and, in addition to modern syntax, it also provides unique features that can
  <em>vastly</em> improve the embedded development experience. Which - let’s be honest!
  - has <em>barely improved</em> in decades.</p>\n<p>So, let’s take a look at some
  of those features! </p>\n<p>For starters, there’s the live REPL. We’ll look at how
  to use the REPL and why having an immediate way to interact with your device is
  an indispensable tool. </p>\n<p>Python’s <code>asyncio</code> is well-supported
  in MicroPython and, it turns out, is a very good fit for embedded devices. We’ll
  look at what makes it such a good fit - and how we can apply libraries like <code>aioble</code>
  and <code>aiorepl</code> to accelerate development.</p>\n<p>To manage a connection
  to your MicroPython device, the core team provides the official tool, <code>mpremote</code>.
  We’ll cover some of the useful features it provides and explain how to integrate
  them into a workflow that allows rapid development.</p>\n<p>Although it’s a high-level
  language, MicroPython balances providing access to low-level features in an accessible
  way. We’ll briefly touch on using such features as the PIO, RMT, USBDevice and register
  access. From there we’ll shift to discuss some of the performance optimisation features
  such as inline assembly, frozen code and the viper and native emitters.</p>\n<p>To
  wrap up, we’ll look at how <em>freakin’ useful</em> it is to be able to run MicroPython
  on x86 (and even in a browser!).</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to cover but these features
  can really help level-up embedded development!</p>"
