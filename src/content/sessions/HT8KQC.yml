abstract: "<p>This presentation will introduce the audience to the fields of electricity
  market modelling and mathematical optimisation (MO).The talk will be comprised of
  three sections:</p>\n<p>The first section will provide some background and context
  for the audience. We will describe what an electricity market is, how it functions,
  and the energy transition which is changing how we build and operate the grid. We
  will also provide some background on mathematical optimisation - how it works, and
  why it is the most common way to model energy markets.</p>\n<p>In the second section,
  we will walk through how you build an optimisation model together. We will describe
  an extremely simple electrical grid, and show we can simulate the dispatch of power
  stations through a mathematical optimisation model. We will also explore some of
  the benefits of these models, including how electricity prices are generated by
  extracting the marginal value of constraints.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will break down
  the core components of a mathematical optimisation model and discuss how this approach
  can be used to solve quantitative problems in many other sectors.</p>"
description: "<p>By 2050, the electrical grid will be a fundamentally different system
  to the one we have today. Over the coming years, we need to learn how to plan, build,
  and run a new type of grid, and all the while preventing it going down, even for
  a second.</p>\n<p>In order to conduct the analysis and experiments required for
  this transition, we need to be able to model the grid in all of its rich detail
  and complexity. If we close a coal power station in New South Wales, build a solar
  farm in Queensland, new transmission lines are delayed in South Australia, or the
  build cost of offshore wind in Victoria changes, we need to be able to rapidly assess
  how this will impact the stability and future of the grid.</p>\n<p>To accomplish
  this, we utilise the analytical technique of mathematical optimisation (MO). This
  allows us to build a mathematical representation of the grid, describe its constraints
  and limitations, and then simulate how it will operate and evolve now and into the
  future.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will introduce the audience to the field
  of electricity market modelling and explain how to turn the data and structure of
  the grid into a mathematical optimisation that we can solve. Weâ€™ll build a very
  simple electricity market dispatch optimisation together and explore the key components
  of an optimisation model that can be applied to problems in multiple industries.</p>"
