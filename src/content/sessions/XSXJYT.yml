abstract: "<p>It's impossible to do software without the power of fonts and text rendering.
  They underpin the terminal we use to run our code, the browsers we use to run our
  web apps and the emails we get paid too much to write.</p>\n<p>But for many they
  are a black box of standards and code that seems to effortlessly click together,
  until they don't. This talk explores how this works from font file structures, internationalization
  issues and font stack management. Finally we use the knowledge we've gained together
  to poke at some non standard use cases for fonts which pull back the curtain to
  show a font file for what it is, arbitrary instructions on how to render a shape
  on the screen. Cats are involved.</p>"
