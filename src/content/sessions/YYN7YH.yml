abstract: <p>Chat GPT is all the rage in schools, and everyone is talking about AI,
  but how do we give students a real understanding of AI’s capabilities and limitations?
  In this talk I’ll demo how you can get students coding their own projects that explore
  (free) GPT technologies, integrating their own data sources, and contemplating when
  AI is the right solution.</p>
description: "<p>This talk is designed for teachers, students, or anyone new to AI
  to get a better understanding of what “AI” is, to see the broad range of technologies
  “AI” can includes, and to demystify all pieces of terminology like GPT, LLMs, and
  more!</p>\n<p>I’ll demo a light-weight project that you can use to get students
  leveraging GPT technology through their own code creations. We’ll then add some
  of our own data to give it specialised knowledge in a technique known as “RAG” (Retrieval
  Augmented Generation). Through the process of testing out this project we’ll then
  explore the moments where students can see behind the curtain of what tools like
  ChatGPT are actually doing, where they fall down and aren’t as “smart” as they seem,
  and how and when to use AI responsibly. </p>\n<p>This talk will specifically highlight
  an open-source option for playing with AI in Python so you can get your class coding
  on these tools for free.</p>"
