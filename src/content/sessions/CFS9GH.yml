abstract: <p>Python is great! It's been a mainstay of web development and systems
  programming for decades and is on the cutting edge of many fields like scientific
  computing. But there is always more to improve, both in the language itself and
  how we use it. This talk will look at how ideas and features from other languages
  like Ruby, Go, and PHP could be used to improve Python!</p>
description: <p>From PHP autolaoders to Goroutines, there's many features in the world
  of programming languages that Python lacks. This talk will outline many features
  from other language communities that could be used both to improve existing codebases
  and, more deeply, to improve and evolve Python itself.</p>
