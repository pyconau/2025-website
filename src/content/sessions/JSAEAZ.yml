abstract: "<p>How do you reproducibly identify and count individual neurons in a brain
  region that’s tiny, diffuse, and surrounded by lookalike regions, especially when
  each 3D brain image is multiple terabytes in size?</p>\n<p>This talk explores this
  very question by diving into the development of a Python-based, end-to-end pipeline
  for analysing whole mouse brains imaged using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy.
  The goal is to quantify the number of individual dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
  nigra pars compacta (SNpc), a small but clinically significant midbrain region implicated
  in Parkinson’s disease.</p>\n<p>Built entirely with open-source Python tools, the
  workflow combines brainreg (from the BrainGlobe ecosystem) for atlas-based registration,
  dask for scalable image processing, and a custom-trained Cellpose model for 3D cell
  segmentation. To address the complexity of region extraction and alignment uncertainty,
  the pipeline includes parameter sweeps, pre-processing optimisation, and quantitative
  evaluation using expert-labelled ground truth masks.</p>\n<p>This talk will also
  highlight how the integration of multiple Python open-source packages supports scalable,
  reproducible neuroimaging analysis, from parallel execution on HPC clusters to image
  registration and deep learning-based segmentation pipelines, as well as quantitative
  methods for assessing alignment fidelity.</p>"
description: "<p>Recent advancements in microscopy have revolutionised medical research
  by enabling imaging of whole organs at incredible resolution. In the world of neuroscience,
  this means that capturing entire mouse brains in 3D at cellular detail is now possible,
  and with this level of resolution, each dataset can easily reach multiple terabytes
  in size. While these rich images hold immense potential for understanding brain
  function and disease, extracting meaningful biological insights (such as counting
  specific neurons in tiny, diffuse regions like the substantia nigra pars compacta
  (SNpc)) poses significant computational and analytical challenges.</p>\n<p>One of
  the toughest problems is accurately defining and extracting these small brain regions.
  The SNpc is surrounded by anatomically similar areas with overlapping cell types,
  making registration and segmentation highly sensitive to small errors. Misalignment
  or imprecise region extraction can lead to inaccurate cell counts, which risks compromising
  the biological conclusions drawn from the data.</p>\n<p>To tackle these issues,
  an end-to-end Python pipeline combining atlas registration with the BrainGlobe ecosystem,
  scalable image processing using dask, and a custom-trained Cellpose deep learning
  model for 3D cell segmentation was developed. This workflow incorporates extensive
  parameter sweeps, preprocessing optimisations, and validation against expert-annotated
  ground truth masks using image similarity metrics to better understand and quantify
  the uncertainties in region extraction.</p>\n<p>Despite these advances, assessing
  and improving region accuracy remains an ongoing challenge. This talk will share
  insights into the complexities of large-scale neuroimaging analysis and highlight
  that while Python provides a powerful toolkit, the problem of reliable, reproducible
  extraction of tiny, complex brain regions is far from solved, representing an active
  area of research and development in the world of bioimage analysis.</p>"
