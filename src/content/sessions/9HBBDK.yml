abstract: "<p>Python has become one of the cornerstone languages for developing scientific
  software, thanks to its flexibility, extensibility, ease of use and extensive ecosystem.
  Whether you’re doing machine learning, processing &amp; visualising data, or running
  a statistical analysis, there’s a good chance there's a Python package that can
  help get you to a result quickly.</p>\n<p>This track is for anyone using Python
  for scientific computing - be it data analysis, engineering, academic research,
  statistics, modelling systems, machine learning, or just generally hacking together
  new tools to extract insight.</p>"
