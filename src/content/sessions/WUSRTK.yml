abstract: "<p>Detecting misconfigured permissions and sensitive data leaks across
  enterprise knowledge base platforms like SharePoint, Confluence and Google Drive
  demands analysing massive volumes of document metadata - permissions, user identities,
  groups, and organisational structures. This challenge rapidly becomes overwhelming
  at scale due to the terabytes of data involved.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll share
  our practical experience building a data pipeline in Python to tackle anomaly detection
  at scale using Dask, a flexible, open-source Python library that enables parallel
  computing and scales data processing workloads seamlessly from a single machine
  to distributed clusters.\nOur pipeline ingests raw metadata from knowledge base
  APIs, transforms it into canonical CSV datasets, and applies a combination of unsupervised
  machine learning techniques (e.g. NMF/SVD), rule-based logic, and sensitive-data-pattern
  detection. Results are translated back into structured formats (jsonl), to publish
  actionable security alerts for our clients.</p>\n<p>Dask’s familiar pythonic API
  let us scale beyond single-node limits and handle large, I/O-heavy computations.
  We'll highlight some key Dask concepts we relied on.</p>\n<p>However, scaling up
  wasn’t without challenges: we faced numerous performance bottlenecks and memory
  management issues, including out-of-memory (OOM) errors and task graph stalls.\n
  I’ll walk through the key strategies we developed to overcome these challenges,
  including custom loaders to better manage memory usage and mitigate issues caused
  by handling large volumes of files. We’ll cover how we used strategic repartitioning
  to rebalance workloads, and selectively persisted intermediate results to avoid
  redundant computation. Finally, we’ll explore how the Dask dashboard helped us pinpoint
  bottlenecks and debug stalled graphs in production.</p>\n<p>Attendees will leave
  with practical insights and effective debugging techniques they can apply to scale
  their own data workloads with Dask.</p>"
