abstract: "<p>How do you get a bunch of teenagers to care about what data they share
  online? How do you teach them how to make a safe password? How do you keep them
  engaged and maybe even teach them some python at the same time?</p>\n<p>These were
  the questions I was asking myself when I created the latest cyber security project
  for our high-school level workshops and it turns out I know the answers!</p>"
description: "<p>Getting kids to think critically about their security online is pretty
  tricky. They get told what they should or shouldn't be doing on social media all
  the time, but is it really sinking in? </p>\n<p>I'll tell you how you can get students
  to really care about cyber security, through a combination of hands-on coding and
  unplugged cyber scavenger hunts. They'll get a real understanding of how hashing
  and rainbow tables and what makes a password secure (or not), and how to protect
  themselves online from social media to phishing emails.</p>"
