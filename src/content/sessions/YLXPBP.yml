abstract: <p>This talk explores how the social sector can leverage responsible GenAI
  and agentic AI to expand equity, inclusion, and impact—while staying true to human
  dignity and ethical principles.</p>
description: "<p>The rise of generative AI and agentic AI presents a game-changing
  opportunity for the social sector—from helping caseworkers triage clients more effectively,
  to offering personalized multilingual support, to freeing staff from admin burdens
  so they can focus on empathy and care.</p>\n<p>But these tools are powerful, and
  must be used responsibly. In this talk, I’ll explore how AI can advance equity and
  access without compromising trust, safety, or human dignity. I’ll cover real-world,
  hands-on use cases from across housing, disability support, crisis response, and
  financial inclusion—many with direct relevance to Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n
  <p>Topics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Using GenAI for form simplification, translation,
  and personalized communication</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Building ethical AI agents to
  support frontline staff and automate routine tasks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensuring
  bias mitigation, data privacy, and accessibility in AI design</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n
  <p>Keeping humans in the loop—augmenting, not replacing social care</p>\n</li>\n
  </ul>\n<p>Attendees will walk away with inspiration, practical ideas, and a mental
  roadmap for adopting AI ethically in service of social good.</p>"
