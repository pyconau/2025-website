abstract: <p>As large language models take over the world, we’re now working alongside
  machines that can read, write and converse – coding with CoPilot, chatting with
  ChatGPT and drawing with DALL-E. But how do machines, which fundamentally operate
  on binary code, achieve such remarkable feats? The answer lies in embeddings. Embeddings
  allow us to represent complex data - whether it's text, images, or even abstract
  concepts - as dense vectors of numbers. In this presentation, we'll demystify embeddings
  and give you a practical and intuitive understanding of how they work.</p>
description: "<p>Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models, and Machine Learning
  have revolutionized our ability to automate complex tasks that once required significant
  human time and effort. But how do machines, which fundamentally operate on binary
  code, achieve such remarkable feats? The answer lies in embeddings - a powerful
  concept at the heart of modern AI. Embeddings are the bridge between human-understandable
  information and the numerical language of computers. They allow us to represent
  complex data - whether it's text, images, or even abstract concepts - as dense vectors
  of numbers. In this presentation, we'll demystify embeddings and give you a practical
  and intuitive understanding of how they work.</p>\n<p>We'll dive into:&lt;br /&gt;\n
  1. What are embeddings and how they enable machines to process and understand human
  language\n2. How you can create your own embeddings or utilise existing embedding
  models to encode language in Python\n3. How embeddings underpin LLMs </p>\n<p>By
  the end, you'll have a solid grasp of this fundamental AI concept and be equipped
  to start experimenting with embeddings in your own projects.</p>"
