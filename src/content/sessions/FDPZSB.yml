abstract: "<p>After over a decade of teaching application development, I became a
  teacher in a local college a few years ago. Over 12 months, I taught open-source
  programming languages, including Python, alongside frameworks and content management
  systems, to various student cohorts. This session will share takeaways from that
  experience.</p>\n<p>The goal of the presentation is to explore the current link
  between the open-source community and academia, examine certain educational institution
  stigmas, and improve how we, as a community, present Python to teachers and students.</p>"
description: "<p>Teaching Python and other open-source technologies in a college has
  provided interesting insights into the challenges and opportunities within academic
  programming education. This session delves into the practical realities of bridging
  the gap between industry best practices and traditional pedagogical approaches.</p>\n
  <p>I will cover the impact of AI (the good and the ugly) on student learning, address
  open-source indifference, discuss proprietary software vendor dominance, point out
  the importance of quality documentation, highlight the value of student reflection
  on real-life projects, and examine how different content and context can profoundly
  change student perception of technology.</p>\n<p>This session is designed for educators,
  open-source contributors, curriculum developers, and anyone passionate about the
  next generation of Python developers. Join me to discuss how together we can refine
  our approach to teaching Python, ensuring students are not just learning a language,
  but embracing a powerful ecosystem and a collaborative mindset.</p>"
