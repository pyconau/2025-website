abstract: <p>Cubescape is a tiny company based in Melbourne that designs, builds,
  and operates Escape Rooms. Our rooms are full of technology and robotics, and run
  a mini-operating system across a network of Raspberry Pis all running python code
  with a heavy dose of asyncio. Starting with Python 3.3 and Debian 8 back in 2014
  we've kept our oldest games running for ten years and will be launching our latest
  game this year with the same codebase, compatibly migrated to 3.11 and Debian 12.
  This talk will dive into our codebase to show how and why we did things the way
  we did, and some lessons learned from keeping a commercial project alive this long.</p>
