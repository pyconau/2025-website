abstract: "<p>I’ve used pandas for years, but as my data grew, my local workflows
  started to slow down. Joins got sluggish, memory errors showed up, and simple tasks
  became harder to manage. That’s when I found DuckDB, a fast, in-process SQL engine
  that brought the speed and flexibility I was missing.</p>\n<p>This talk isn’t about
  replacing pandas. It’s about knowing when to reach for something different. I’ll
  share how DuckDB helped streamline my workflow, with real examples, side-by-side
  comparisons, and a quick intro to DuckLake, a SQL-based Lakehouse format that fits
  naturally into modern Python analytics.</p>"
description: "<p>This talk picks up where that shift began. I’ll walk through the
  challenges I hit with pandas and how DuckDB gradually became a core part of my workflow.
  We’ll explore how it handles real data tasks, complements existing tools, and helps
  simplify analysis. You’ll also see how local-first tools like DuckDB and DuckLake
  can streamline data work without needing extra infrastructure.</p>\n<p>By the end
  of the session, you’ll:\n- Recognize where pandas starts to struggle and why it’s
  okay to want more\n- See how DuckDB can supercharge your workflow without changing
  everything\n- Leave with real-world tips for faster analytics with no cluster required</p>"
