abstract: "<p>At synchrotron facilities, researchers use high-energy X-rays to uncover
  the structure and chemistry of materials — from batteries to biological systems.
  These experiments generate vast amounts of complex, high-dimensional data, and scientists
  need flexible tools, interactive exploration, and smart automation to make sense
  of it all. In this talk, we present a Python-based data processing suite designed
  to support X-ray spectroscopy workflows: from generating immediate data products
  to inform critical decisions during limited beamtime, to in-depth reprocessing off-site
  — or even offline.</p>\n<p>The suite is built around a processing library that uses
  <code>xarray</code> for intuitive multi-dimensional data handling and provides reproducible,
  transparent analysis pipelines via command-line tools and Jupyter notebooks for
  coding-affine users. It also includes a <code>PyQt</code>-based desktop GUI that
  enables domain scientists to interactively explore their data and fine-tune processing
  steps without the need for prior programming experience.</p>\n<p>We'll explore how
  Python libraries like <code>xarray</code>, <code>pyqtgraph</code>, and <code>typer</code>
  take the processing of raw experimental data from low-level wrangling in multiple
  dimensions to high-level exploration in intuitive interfaces. By providing different
  levels of balance between automation and user control we enable scientists with
  all levels of programming experience to create insightful datasets — whether they're
  at the beamline, back at their home institution, or already on the plane to the
  next conference.</p>"
