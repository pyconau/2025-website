abstract: "<p>When you're learning to code, no matter what the language, you learn
  small components: write a function to do something, create a class to do other things,
  add a user interface component and so on.</p>\n<p>Then you get out into the real
  world and there's nobody telling you what components to write. You know how to code,
  but you don't know how to develop. So you do more courses and tutorials, watch more
  videos and read more documentation. But you still don't know how to take that extra
  step and apply your knowledge to develop an entire project. You're stuck in <strong>tutorial
  hell</strong>!</p>\n<p>I'm going to go beyond the code and show you how to design,
  structure, and document your projects. I'll also show you how you can use AI to
  help.</p>\n<p>These problems and their solutions will apply to every language and
  development environment you'll use through your career, whether or not you're using
  Python. By the end, I hope I will have given you some tools to help you escape from
  tutorial hell and start developing your own projects.</p>"
description: "<p>One of the problems you need to solve to escape from tutorial hell
  is working out what code to write. Before you write a single line of code, step
  away from the computer and design your project. What exactly is it going to do?
  What platforms does it need to run on? What technologies will you use to build it?
  With these decisions made, you can break down the project into smaller parts that
  you already know how to do.</p>\n<p>Project structure is fundamental to reading
  and maintaining your project. Over the life span of any development project, the
  code will be read - by you or by other developers - far more often than it is written
  or edited. Logical file structures and consistently formatted code make it easier
  to find the code you need. Naming is considered one of the great problems of programming
  but using good names for your files, classes, functions and variables makes your
  code more usable and more readable.</p>\n<p>Documentation is crucial for any project,
  whether you're working alone or in a team. First, I'll look at strategies for discovering
  and reading official documentation. Then I'll talk about documenting your own code.
  I'll also discuss strategies for keeping your knowledge up to date.</p>\n<p>AI is
  a powerful tool that can help you write or improve code. I'll talk about ways to
  improve the results that AI gives you and discuss some of the pros and cons of using
  AI in your teaching, learning, and development process.</p>"
