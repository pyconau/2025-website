abstract: "<p>How can we sustain open source software?</p>\n<p>As multiple companies
  re-license their projects to move away from open source, and maintainers everywhere
  are getting burnt out, it’s time to rethink how to make open source sustainable.</p>\n
  <p>We present a checklist for assessing the health of an open source project to
  see if it might be at risk, and what to do about it.</p>\n<p>You’ll learn some approaches
  for setting up an open source project for long-term success, and some other ideas
  about how we might keep this thing we all love alive.</p>"
description: "<p>For the last 10 to 15 years, open source software has been dominated
  by a bunch of VC-funded startups writing software and giving it away for free.</p>\n
  <p>That was, probably, a really silly thing for most of them to do. Why did they
  do it? And what might we do differently?</p>\n<p>Learn how to recognise the economic
  structures that lead to decisions that are unhelpful for open source sustainability.
  Learn how to design a project structure that gives provides the best chance at being
  sustainable. Learn how to diagnose the problems in your own projects before they
  hit crisis point. Most importantly: learn what changes to make and how to make them.</p>"
