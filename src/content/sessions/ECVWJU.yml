abstract: "<p>In this talk, we’ll explore four modern data engines ; Daft, DuckDB,
  Polaris, and DataFusion, that offer varying levels of out-of-core execution. These
  engines allow you to work with datasets larger than memory without the need to rewrite
  everything for a distributed system.</p>\n<p>They’re fast, expressive, and, above
  all, Pythonic—though SQL support might still be the deciding factor for many workflows.</p>\n
  <p>Rather than comparing which engine is best (they’re all open source, and good
  ideas tend to spread quickly), this talk will highlight exciting recent developments.
  We’ll showcase, for example, how one workload saw a 2× performance boost in under
  a year, and how open table formats are bringing cloud data warehouse capabilities
  to local Python workflows.</p>"
