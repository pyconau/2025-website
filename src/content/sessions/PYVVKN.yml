abstract: <p>Time series data is everywhere. Across industries such as environmental
  monitoring, financial market analysis, power and energy systems, and scientific
  discovery, organisations rely on analysing large volumes of complex time series
  data to make smart and informed decisions that help keep the world running smoothly.
  Two of the most critical tasks in time series analysis are Time Series Classification
  and Time Series Forecasting. Pythonâ€™s data science ecosystem for time series analysis
  has grown significantly in recent years. In this talk, we will introduce the modern
  landscape of time series tools available in Python. We will demonstrate the usability,
  algorithmic diversity, and interface design of libraries such as Sktime, Aeon, and
  Nixtla (NeuralForecast, MLForecast). These libraries will serve as examples to show
  how easy they are to use, what kinds of algorithms they provide, and how their application
  programming interfaces are structured to support efficient and intuitive development.
  Whether your goal is to classify environmental patterns or forecast future trends,
  these tools can simplify and accelerate your time series analysis workflow.</p>
