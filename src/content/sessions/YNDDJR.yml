abstract: "<p>\"What's the last common ancestor of a bear and a weasel?\"\n\"Which
  animals are more related to pigs than cows?\"\n\"Are birds reptiles?\"\n\"Am I a
  fish?\"</p>\n<p>With a recent interest in phylogeny – the science of evolution,
  diversification, and speciation – these are the kinds of questions I've been asking
  myself. I wanted to find a tool that would let me examine the relationships between
  species and find the answers to these questions, but, as I looked around I couldn't
  find anything that did what I wanted. So I made it myself.</p>\n<p>Come with me
  as I share my journey that led me to talk to some of Australia's top scientists,
  give up on talking to other top scientists, and accidentally stumble my way into
  making an actual contribution to science. Learn why I made this tool, how I made
  this tool, what stage it's at, and where you can use it yourself. And maybe learn
  some things about life on Earth along the way.</p>\n<p>Oh, and to answer the questions
  above: dog-bears, peccaries, yes, and yes!</p>"
description: "<p>I've always been interested in zoology – my dad has a degree in zoology
  – and over the past year or two, I've started learning more about phylogeny. Phylogeny
  is the study of the evolution of species, seeking to understand their common ancestors,
  when and how they branched, and how closely related various species are.</p>\n<p>A
  common tool in phylogeny is the cladogram, a \"tree of life\" showing the different
  relationships between species. Cladograms are a great tool for understanding a family
  of organisms. However, when I started wanting to explore cladograms myself, I couldn't
  find anything that had all the features I wanted. This led me to start building
  it myself, and as I did so, I started thinking that maybe it was something that
  scientists and educators might find useful.</p>\n<p>And so I dove into the problem
  with gusto, and built a cladogram tool that could do it all, and is nice and user
  friendly, and great for students of all ages. In this talk I'll explain what I wanted
  it to do, the saga of trying to work out if it already existed, and how I built
  the tool. I'll also show you where you can access it to try out yourself and maybe
  learn something interesting about your favourite animal!</p>"
