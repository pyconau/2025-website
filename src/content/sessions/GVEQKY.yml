abstract: "<p>Number 5 will shock you!\nForget what you think you know about robust
  dependency graphs, the security gains of living at Head, and those supposedly solid
  requirements.txt. We'll get down to the nitty-gritty of open source security, giving
  you real-world large-scale insights to understanding common misconceptions across
  programming ecosystems. </p>\n<p>While it’s true that there is only one dependency
  graph<em> (</em>for you) (*right now) it’s not always understood what impact this
  can have at an ecosystem level.</p>\n<p>We’ve got ecosystem level stats on just
  how many PURLs map to multiple different packages, dependency graph shifts that
  happen faster than you can type git commit, and some surprises with Git (im)mutability!
  </p>\n<p>We will talk about vulnerabilities in your transitive dependencies, understanding
  what even ARE your dependencies, and trying to identify what that one (*for certain
  values of one) CVE you were supposedly affected by actually is. (Not to mention
  what, if anything, you can do about it.)</p>\n<p>You’ll leave this talk with a better
  understanding of open source edge cases and just how common they are. You’ll be
  shocked, amazed, horrified, and hopefully a little optimistic about the state of
  open source security and your place within it.</p>"
description: "<p>We all make assumptions about our builds and dependencies, but those
  can lead to misunderstandings and surprises. We aim to test these assumptions by
  highlighting unexpected things we’ve learned from analysing the world’s open source
  code, leading to a common understanding of what makes this space so complex and
  ambiguous. </p>\n<p>This talk will cover information about Python as well as many
  other programming environments.</p>"
