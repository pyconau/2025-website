abstract: <p>Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing
  and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest
  that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, where vertices divide into
  groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple
  scales. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure
  from network data and demonstrate that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously
  explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties
  of networks(Eg Terrorist Networks), such as right-skewed degree distributions, high
  clustering coefficients, and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge
  of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partially
  known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than
  competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central
  organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many
  network phenomena</p>
description: "<p>A great deal of recent work has been devoted to the study of clustering
  and community structure in networks. Hierarchical structure goes beyond simple clustering,
  however, by explicitly including organization at all scales in a network simultaneously.
  Conventionally, hierarchical structure is represented by a tree or dendrogram in
  which closely related pairs of vertices have lowest common ancestors that are lower
  in the tree than those of more distantly related pairsâ€”. We expect the probability
  of a connection between two vertices to depend on their degree of relatedness. Structure
  of this type can be modeled mathematically using a probabilistic approach in which
  we endow each internal node r of the dendrogram with a probability pr and then connect
  each pair of vertices for whom r is the lowest common ancestor independently with
  probability pr  This model, which we call a hierarchical random graph, is similar
  in spirit (although different in realization) to the tree-based models used in some
  studies of network search and navigation . Like most work on community structure,
  it assumes that communities at each level of organization are disjoint. Overlapping
  communities have occasionally been studied  and could be represented using a more
  elaborate probabilistic model, but as we discuss below the present model already
  captures many of the structural features of interest.</p>\n<p>Given a dendrogram
  and a set of probabilities pr, the hierarchical random graph model allows us to
  generate artificial networks with a specified hierarchical structure, a procedure
  that might be useful in certain situations. Our goal here, however, is a different
  one. We would like to detect and analyze the hierarchical structure, if any, of
  networks in the real world. We accomplish this by fitting the hierarchical model
  to observed network data using the tools of statistical inference, combining a maximum
  likelihood approach  with a Monte Carlo 2 sampling algorithm on the space of all
  possible dendrograms. This technique allows us to sample hierarchical random graphs
  with probability proportional to the likelihood that they generate the observed
  network. To obtain the results described below we combine information from a large
  number of such samples, each of which is a reasonably likely model of the data.</p>"
