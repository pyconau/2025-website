abstract: <p>You, by which I mean all the Eukaryotes in the audience, are running
  on an operating system a couple of billion years old. Every cell in your body is
  full of primordial libraries, monkey patches, self-modifying code, viral hacks and
  even containers embedding a different operating system.  This talk is all about
  the freakish parallels between cell biology and computer architecture, and will
  leave you less confident than ever that your seemingly complex life is anything
  more than a molecule's way of making more molecules.</p>
description: <p>A fun talk intended to get the audience thinking about what programmers
  can learn from biology and biologists can learn from computer science, and to remind
  you that no matter how weird technology gets, nature has us all beat.</p>
