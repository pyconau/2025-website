abstract: "<p>Making an open source package is pretty hard in 2024. Expectations are
  high, and there’s a lot to take into account. I recently developed an open source
  package. This talk covers what worked, what didn’t work, what I would do again and
  what I would do differently.</p>\n<p>I developed an open source package called “scores”
  ( https://github.com/nci/scores , https://scores.readthedocs.io/ ).  This is not
  a presentation about what “scores” does, but instead covers the lessons I learned.
  Despite being an experienced software developer and having used lots of open source
  software, there was still a lot to learn (and a lot to figure out) about open source
  package maintenance.</p>\n<p>Every package is different, but this is what I did
  and these are the lessons I learned. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical Matters:<ul>\n<li>How
  to lay things out on disk</li>\n<li>Configuration files</li>\n<li>Automated testing</li>\n
  <li>Type hinting</li>\n<li>Linting and other static analysis tools</li>\n<li>Code
  layout and design</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Documentation:<ul>\n<li>What documentation
  to produce</li>\n<li>Picking and using a tech stack</li>\n<li>Rendering (documentation
  often renders differently in different locations)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ecosystem
  Integration:<ul>\n<li>How to fit in well with the tools around you</li>\n<li>Versioning
  </li>\n<li>Publishing to PyPI</li>\n<li>How and what to automate</li>\n<li>How to
  do releases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Community Considerations:<ul>\n<li>Code review
  standards</li>\n<li>Clear presentation of information</li>\n<li>Understanding your
  user base and audience</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"
