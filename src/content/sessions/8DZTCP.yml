abstract: "<p>When academic engineering tools remain trapped in Matlab while the industry
  relies on Excel, Python offers a unique opportunity to bridge this computational
  divide. While academic software packages for the efficient design of light-gauge
  steel have been available for several years, they effectively require highly specialised
  expertise to use and understand—challenging the material’s adoption beyond highly
  specialised buildings. This talk presents a case study of transforming CUFSM, a
  trusted but highly technical Matlab package for the finite strip analysis of light-gauge
  steel, into pyCUFSM—a performant and open-source Python implementation deployable
  to AWS Lambda.</p>\n<p>The migration revealed and addressed several key scientific
  Python challenges. Moving from Matlab’s matrix-oriented syntax to idiomatic Python
  required not only converting every index from 1-based to 0-based, but also careful
  architectural decisions around NumPy array handling and SciPy linear algebra operations.
  Performance bottlenecks were addressed through strategic use of Cython compilation
  and aggressive pre-allocation and reuse of data structures, achieving a p90 duration
  of 3.9 seconds for real-world usage. </p>\n<p>However, technical performance alone
  wasn’t sufficient. In regulated industries where engineers face personal liability
  for design failures, trust and transparency are paramount. Not only must the interpretation
  of inputs and outputs not leave any doubt, but the calculations themselves must
  be validatable by the user - without having to read or understand code. By coupling
  this Python analysis package with a React-based frontend, a calculator was developed
  which requires only 4 inputs, shows all intermediate steps with full rendered equations,
  and still allows access to advanced parameters for those who want it. Extensively
  validated, such an implementation is showing significant gains in adoption by the
  wider structural engineering community. The final system demonstrates how Python's
  strengths—from scientific libraries to cloud deployment—can bring academic innovation
  into wider use in regulated industries where reliability, ease of use, and user
  trust are essential.</p>"
