abstract: "<p>NaviLens is a for-profit service that provides navigational data resolution,
  based on ddTags placed around the environment. The tags are designed so that they
  can be quickly scanned with a mobile device while at a much greater distance than
  QR codes or while moving. The main use case of NaviLens is to improve navigation
  for those with visual impairments. </p>\n<p>This system is now in use on trams in
  Melbourne, Australia. I argue that while this is a step in the right direction for
  accessibility, it also grants monopolistic control of the “physical namespace” to
  a profit seeking entity.</p>\n<p>This talk will explore the technology behind Navilens
  and the social issues around its adoption. I'll demonstrate a path to a free and
  open alternative using Python and the community dataset that was started during
  PyCon AU 2024.</p>"
