abstract: "<p>Providing the right context to large language models is challenging.
  Every integration—whether accessing local files, connecting to Google Calendar,
  or querying internal databases—requires custom work. Each tool connection becomes
  a separate, manual effort. This is where MCP comes in. Model Context Protocol (MCP),
  in simple terms, is a universal adapter for AI models that need external context.
  It standardizes how context is passed to models, making it easier to build and manage
  these connections.</p>\n<p>My talk will not only focus on how to get started with
  MCP, but I will also outline how to build MCP Agents using your own MCP Server tools
  and the MCP Client UI with Streamlit. At the end of my talk, we will also discuss
  the security issues associated with MCP and how one can mitigrate those.</p>"
