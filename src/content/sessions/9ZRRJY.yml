abstract: <p>Database indexes allow us to speed up queries by providing a method to
  quickly look up data. However, do we always check that they actually improve performance?
  In this talk, I explain how and why an automatically added database index did not
  get used by the queries we expected. Together we will go through SQL produced from
  Django ORM, index structures and generating database query plans to unravel what
  was actually going on behind the scenes in our queries.</p>
description: <p>Within my current role on the performance team, it is my responsibility
  to investigate sources of and solutions to poor database performance within our
  company's application. Understanding the how and why of database indexes has been
  an important part of this, however, my knowledge of database indexes is a relatively
  recently gained experience. In this talk I aim to share what I have learnt along
  the way as applied to investigating why an index added in Django was not improving
  the performance of our database query.</p>
