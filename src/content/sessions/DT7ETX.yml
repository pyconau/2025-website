abstract: <p>What happens when you combine quantum computing, neuroscience, and reinforcement
  learning—all in Python? This talk explores how parameterized quantum circuits can
  be used as “brains” for agents inspired by the nematode C. elegans, and how these
  agents learn to navigate their world using reinforcement learning. We’ll see how
  quantum and classical approaches compare, and what this means for the future of
  AI and quantum machine learning.</p>
description: "<p>Can quantum computing help us build smarter, more efficient learning
  agents? In this talk, we’ll dive into a Python project that simulates the behaviour
  of the nematode C. elegans using reinforcement learning—once with a classical neural
  network, and once with a quantum circuit as the agent’s brain.</p>\n<p>We’ll cover:</p>\n
  <ul>\n<li>The neuroscience inspiration: why C. elegans is a model organism for both
  biology and AI.</li>\n<li>How to encode sensory features and actions for both quantum
  and classical agents.</li>\n<li>The basics of variational quantum algorithms and
  how parameterized quantum circuits can be trained using reinforcement learning.</li>\n
  <li>How Python (with Qiskit and PyTorch) enables rapid prototyping and benchmarking
  of these agents.</li>\n<li>What we learn from comparing quantum and classical brains:
  learning speed, sample efficiency, and emergent behaviours.</li>\n<li>Live demos
  and visualizations of agents learning to solve mazes and perform chemotaxis.</li>\n
  </ul>\n<p>Whether you’re a quantum enthusiast, ML practitioner, or just curious
  about the intersection of biology and AI, you’ll leave with new ideas and practical
  tools for exploring these fields in Python.</p>"
