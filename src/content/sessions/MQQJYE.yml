abstract: "<p>Discover the innovative work happening at the Australian Synchrotron,
  where high-energy X-rays support research across Australia and neighbouring countries.
  The scientific computing team uses Python to connect to hardware, orchestrate experiments,
  and process data.</p>\n<p>We'll focus on a Python Dash interface developed to commission
  new positioners and detectors. This interface automatically generates Gaussian statistics.
  It includes pages for both one positioner and one detector (1D) or two positioners
  and one detector (2D), and allows users to click on a 2D Gaussian to take horizontal
  and vertical slices.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will discuss best programming practices,
  such as implementing unit tests, maintaining DRY principles, and using linting tools
  to improve code quality. Good programming practices work beautifully in a scientific
  environment.  Join us to learn how these techniques can enhance your work with Python.</p>"
