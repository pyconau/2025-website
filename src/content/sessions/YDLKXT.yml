abstract: <p>Frustrated at the inevitable paralysis of "which GUI library will my
  students hate the least", excited about the possibilities of a new toy in Streamlit
  and  drunk on the power of having recently learned about Github Codespaces, our
  intrepid educator ventured out on a journey of discovery and (mis)adventure. Would
  interactive data dashboards be the key to unlocking engagement? Would students ever
  learn to commit their work? Would the tiniest little technical snag derail entire
  lessons?</p>
description: "<p>Streamlit is a rapid development environment designed primarily for
  data scientists to build quick, interactive web apps to showcase their wares. It
  is great at getting applications online with relatively little fuss - an approach
  that makes it a fun candidate for building students' coding skills in an environment
  that provides some quick reward for effort. </p>\n<p>I gave this a go with a group
  of Year 10 students in a digital technology elective with a group with wildly varying
  engagement and Python skills and think I learned enough for it to be worth sharing
  the results. Since trying this in 2024 with Year 10 I have used the same tool for
  a Year 12 VCE Data Analytics class with additional insights I'd love to share with
  you. </p>\n<p>This presentation will discuss Streamlit and some benefits that might
  make it work well for the secondary classroom environment; some of the pedagogical
  and technical obstacles that popped up (and you might be able to avoid) as well
  as some broader discussion on just trying things out in the classroom. I'll also
  cover the use of Github Classroom and Codespaces as a way of getting Streamlit running
  for students.</p>"
