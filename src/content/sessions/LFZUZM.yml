abstract: "<p>When teaching computer science, many students stuggle with the wide
  variety of concepts. One week you're learning programming, the next you're learning
  cybersecurity, then you're learning about image file formats. It can be hard to
  see how these topics are related, or if they even are related!</p>\n<p>Without sufficient
  context, these are just abstract topics, disconnected from reality and from each
  other, with rote memorisation the only tool at hand to help you get things right
  on the exam. With context, however, things start to make sense. You understand how
  the topics relate, how these technologies developed and evolved, and can derive
  solutions rather than memorising them.</p>\n<p>This context – \"why\" is the technology
  the way it is? – fundamentally changes how students connect with the subject, but
  with curriculums so jam packed it can be hard to justify the time to go into this
  level of detail. I found, however, that when I did cover the \"why\", I spent less
  time on revision, more time on discussion, and students had better results.</p>\n
  <p>I want to share with you a few examples of how I did this, what happened when
  I discussed those in class, and how I go about finding the \"why\" when I don't
  already know what it is. Hopefully, I can give you some new tools for your own teaching,
  and – critically – explain the \"why\" behind these tools too.</p>"
description: "<p>I came to teaching through an uncommon path, and had a very privleged
  teaching environment. These, and other, factors allowed me to really develop my
  own teaching style, inspired by those teachers who most impacted me.</p>\n<p>My
  focus on the \"why\" grew from this, as I wanted to ensure that my students not
  only passed the class and did well, but felt inspired by learning, encouraged in
  curiosity, and that they knew that if they did enough research and asked enough
  questions they truly could understand anything and see how everything is interconnected.
  By ensuring I taught the context behind each topic, my students flourished, with
  their grades improving as they got more familiar with this method, and culminating
  in excellent exam results.</p>"
