abstract: "<p>Sometimes you inherit a clunky pipeline. Sometimes an LLM writes one
  for you. Either way, you’re stuck with something slow, memory-hungry, and hard to
  scale.</p>\n<p>This talk is about what happens next — how to turn a naive tabular
  data pipeline into something fast, efficient, and scalable. You’ll get a guided
  tour through a zoo of optimization techniques: reducing algorithmic complexity,
  minimizing memory usage, improving I/O throughput, and swapping in Polars — a fast,
  Rust-based DataFrame library — in place of Pandas (for reasons beyond just hype).
  By walking through a real-world example step by step, you’ll see how each change
  makes an impact — and come away with a sharper eye for spotting similar bottlenecks
  or inefficiencies in your own pipelines.</p>\n<p>The walkthrough is grounded in
  a real-world ML feature engineering task from the aviation industry. But in the
  spirit of spring, we’ll swap baggage belts for bird feeders — and reframe the problem
  through a birdwatcher’s lens, not by tracking airport operations, but by counting
  sparrows and mynas visiting my backyard feeder.</p>"
description: '<p>This talk walks through how we made a slow, memory-hungry feature
  engineering pipeline radically (~50×) faster and more memory-efficient using a range
  of optimization techniques. We’ll start with a naive baseline — the kind of code
  you might get from an LLM: nested loops, written in Pandas, reading and writing
  CSVs. From there, we’ll iterate step by step, showing how each change impacts performance,
  using concise code snippets, Polars syntax, and real metrics. The goal isn’t to
  go deep on any one technique, but to give you a broad, practical map of the optimization
  landscape — and a better feel for spotting and fixing slow, clunky pipelines in
  the wild.</p>'
