abstract: "<p>The Golden Era of Open Source, in whose late stages we currently exist,
  has been defined by early decisions to release code with no expectations around
  who uses our code, and what happens when people abuse the gift they’ve been gifted.
  Little thought was given to what consequences an extractive or abusive party would
  face.</p>\n<p>Today, we’ve allowed maintainer burnout to take hold in community
  and volunteer-led projects (with disastrous consequences, see for example xz), and
  we’re seeing mass rejection of attempts by corporations to impose consequences on
  those who seek to continue extractive behaviour (see for example Hashicorp’s rapid
  demise as an independent entity).</p>\n<p>This contrasts to some of the earlier
  eras in Free and Open Source Software, which were defined by social contracts with
  consequences for those who chose not to follow them, most notably (but not entirely)
  those informed by the concept of Copyleft.</p>\n<p>By choosing not to define consequences
  for disobeying the social contract of Open Source, the broader ecosystem has chosen
  consequences for us. In this talk, I’ll look at some points of inflection through
  the history of Open Source where our movement collectively decided imposing consequences,
  the (in retrospect) highly predictable results of those decisions, and what we could
  have decided instead. I’ll also talk a bit about how we might want to think about
  consequences in the future.</p>"
