abstract: "<p>How many dependencies does your software project have? How much confidence
  do you have in them? We sometimes say in open source there is safety in ‘eyes on
  the code’, but with supply chain attacks on the rise, who is really watching?</p>\n
  <p>Most software is built with hundreds if not thousands of direct and transitive
  dependencies, and those dependencies change every day. Our analysis shows that up
  to 20% of PyPI packages change their dependency graphs multiple times per week.
  Ensuring that each one of these dependencies is trustworthy is a daunting task.</p>\n
  <p>In this talk, we will share some stats and stories from building deps.dev. We
  will look at what it means for a project to be healthy, dig into the complexities
  of dependency resolution algorithms, and recommend tools that can make practical
  dependency management possible if not easy.</p>"
