abstract: "<p>Samples used for diffraction experiments at the Australian Synchrotron,
  a research facility in Melbourne, are typically presented as finely ground powders
  confined inside very thin (1mm or less) glass capillaries. These samples are irradiated
  with X-rays in order to uncover their atomic crystal structures. Amongst our research
  areas, we study applications in mining, solar cells, perovskites, hydrogen storage,
  and geology, where understanding material properties at the atomic level can lead
  to advancements such as enhancing mineral extraction processes, improving solar
  cell efficiency, developing better hydrogen storage solutions, and analysing the
  composition of meteorites.</p>\n<p>To ensure good data quality, the capillary needs
  to rotate precisely around its centre of rotation in front of the X-ray beam. Alignment
  of the centre of rotation is usually a manual operation that relies on the human
  eye and expertise to discern that the capillary is straight and stationary while
  it rotates around its axis; this process can be lengthy, error-prone, and difficult
  to achieve, especially for non-experts.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will demonstrate
  how we have united Python, OpenCV, and motion control systems to automate the capillary
  alignment procedure at the Australian Synchrotron, reducing the time to align a
  sample from several minutes to just 10 seconds.</p>"
