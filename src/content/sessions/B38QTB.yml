abstract: "<p>From default args, to <code>**kwargs</code>, and everything in-between,
  Python's comprehensive argument system lends itself to some of the most effective
  code, through encouraging readability, reuse, and easy refactoring.</p>\n<p>But
  is that really true? Why, and why not?\nWhat could we learn from other languages?\n
  And what else could lie in their future?</p>"
description: "<p>In this session, we'll give a rundown of Python's comprehensive function
  argument system and how its features allow for safety, conciseness, and expressiveness
  (whether you're calling or writing functions).</p>\n<p>We'll then give examples
  for where that system lacks, where it could bite you, and give suggestions for what
  more could be done on Python code to fix those limitations.</p>"
