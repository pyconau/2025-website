abstract: "<p>A review and comparison of software available for causal discovery in
  Python. Causal discovery means learning \"what causes what\" from your data. The
  input is a tabular dataset; the output is a causal graphical model (or a set of
  potential models) over your features. If feature A affects feature B, there should
  be an arrow A--&gt;B in the causal graphical model. Causal discovery is useful for
  hypothesis generation, experiment selection, and for testing our assumptions around
  causation.</p>\n<p>I'll give a brief intro to causal discovery, then review the
  following packages: py-tetrad, causal-learn, tigramite, causalnex, and cdt (causal
  discovery toolbox). The packages have some overlap but different emphases: each
  one implements at least one algorithm not covered by the other packages, making
  them useful in different situations. If time permits I'll finish with a quick demo,
  showing each package learning a model from the same dataset.</p>"
