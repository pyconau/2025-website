abstract: <p>How can you find relevant needles in a haystack of 25,000 academic abstracts
  when keyword searching is useless? I explore how I used Python to automate my way
  out of systematic review hell.</p>
description: "<p>Systematic reviews are the highest form of scientific evidence –
  the ultimate summary of all existing studies. I started my PhD thinking that finding
  the right papers to read was just matter of using the right keywords. But then I
  ended up with over 25,000 research papers – way too many to read or filter with
  traditional methods. Impossible, right?</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I know Python! Come
  with me on a journey through the challenges of sifting through mountains of research.
  I dive into how I used Python to automate finding relevant papers for my systematic
  review, wrestling with PubMed’s quirky download format, using regular expressions
  to find all the creative ways people refer to childbirth in the literature, and
  using LLMs to extract information from the abstracts. I’ll also explain why “NOT
  ‘dog’” didn’t work for me.</p>\n<p>This talk is for anyone who’s ever felt lost
  in a sea of academic papers, or just wants to hear a story of how Python became
  my secret weapon in the systematic review process.</p>"
