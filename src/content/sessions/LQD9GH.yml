abstract: "<p>I found some vulnerabilities in Python's standard library, and now you've
  all had to upgrade your Python. Sorry, not sorry.</p>\n<p>My day job is focused
  on open source and software supply chain security. This has made me curious - how
  trustworthy even are the core technologies our ecosystems are built on - like 46
  year old archiving formats?</p>\n<p>So after I read a vulnerability report that
  exploited symlinks in TAR files, I wondered whether Python suffered the same problem.
  I started poking around and ended up finding an arbitrary write path traversal in
  Python's standard library.</p>\n<p>This talk will provide a detailed look at this
  vulnerability and demonstrate how it can be exploited by an attacker to compromise
  an exposed system.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ll also discuss how these vulnerabilities demonstrate
  key security challenges facing developers while building their projects. The challenges
  range from the different incentives between libraries and their applications, the
  limits of abstractions, and the difficulties of hardening legacy code.</p>\n<p>With
  movement towards more regulation, like the EU's Cyber Resilience Act, and more interest
  in improving software security, appreciating these security challenges can help
  developers focus more on building exciting projects than mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>"
