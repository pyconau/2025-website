abstract: "<p>How do translations preserve the original meaning, style, and sentiment
  of texts across different languages and cultural contexts? This intriguing question
  drives our study as we delve into the complexities of translation.</p>\n<p>We examine
  how sentiment analysis results differ for the same text in various languages, aiming
  to understand the role of language families in these variations. Using natural language
  processing techniques in Python, we analyse novels from diverse genres, time periods,
  and cultural backgrounds to uncover generalisable translation patterns.</p>\n<p>Our
  study seeks to answer whether translations of words, ideas, and societal contexts
  in novels are influenced by the cultural contexts into which they are translated.
  By highlighting the importance of accurate and culturally relevant translations,
  we emphasise how they play a crucial role in preserving cultural and societal knowledge,
  ensuring that the richness of the original text is maintained across languages.</p>"
description: "<p>Our project aims to find out how closely translations preserve the
  original meaning and style of text, whether the sentiment expressed in the original
  text is consistently preserved across different translations, and how sentiment
  analysis results vary for the same text in different languages. </p>\n<p>As such,
  we have chosen novels based on different genres and societies, so that we can analyse
  words in various contexts. We have also chosen our novels based on the languages
  we are analysing, making sure we include books that are originally written by both
  languages and other languages. </p>\n<p>In this project, we created several study
  groups of languages. For instance, we might put English with Mandarin Chinese together,
  so that we can analyse different language families. In each language group, we will
  assign source and target language, and find the translation patterns within the
  group. To generalise translation patterns, we repeated the analyses on multiple
  books and across multiple language groups. Then, we applied feature extraction to
  extract semantic, stylistic, syntactic and sentiment features from translations
  of novels. And lastly, to apply sentiment preservation by applying sentiment analysis
  and comparative semantic analysis to generalise language features in translation.
  </p>\n<p>This project is important to us because we are both students from multilingual
  backgrounds and interact with translations every day. We realised that the same
  articles translated into different languages may not necessarily bring out the same
  ideologies or sentiments. Therefore, we are interested in how translation of a text
  will vary in different contexts, and whether the language family plays a big role
  in this. We believe this project is important as it can impact how one would understand
  particular historical, cultural or societal knowledge of a community if not done
  well. </p>\n<p>We considered the differences in translation styles when translated
  by different authors, as well as different editing styles. To conquer this, we analysed
  works from different authors and translators to minimise the impact of stylistic
  differences.</p>"
