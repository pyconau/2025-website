abstract: <p>In this workshop we will learn two ways to build AI Agents on AWS. We
  will learn how to create an agent with the Amazon Strands SDK that is model agnostic,
  creating a sample application as we go. We will also explore alternate ways we can
  create agents within Amazon Bedrock and how in each case we can connect to an MCP
  server and use its tools.</p>
