abstract: "<p>Models based on physical processes and equations of motion have been
  built, over decades, to model the physical structure and composition of the ocean,
  atmosphere, and land surface.  Other scientific models have been built to process
  very complex, high-dimensional data from instruments such as satellites and radar
  into simpler data products such as images and surface field estimates. These models
  are often computationally intensive.</p>\n<p>Prior to around 2022, the complexity
  of many of these tasks was seen as infeasible for machine learning systems. In the
  years since, deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
  the types of models described above. </p>\n<p>PyEarthTools is an open-source, Python
  software framework that supports the development of machine learning models, big
  and small, for Earth system science. See https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  .</p>\n<p>PyEarthTools contains modules for:\n- Loading and indexing Earth system
  data into Xarray;\n- Processing and normalising Earth system data for machine learning;\n
  - Defining machine learning (ML) models;\n- Training ML models and managing experiments;
  and\n- Evaluating ML models.</p>\n<p>Come to this talk to learn how to:\n- Get started
  with machine learning for Earth system science\n- Learn about the PyEarthTools framework
  and how to build re-usable ML pipelines\n- Catch the science bug and try out some
  simple projects\n- Train your own weather models from scratch</p>\n<p>This talk
  is suitable for beginners through to professional scientists and data scientists.</p>\n
  <p>PyEarthTools was initially developed by the Bureau of Meteorology (Australia),
  and now also has developers from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
  Research (New Zealand), and the Met Office (United Kingdom).</p>"
