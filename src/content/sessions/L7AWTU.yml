abstract: <p>PyEarthTools is an open-source, Python software framework that supports
  the development of machine learning models, big and small, for Earth system science.
  See https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/ .</p>
description: "<p>Models based on physical processes and equations of motion have been
  built, over decades, to model the physical structure and composition of the ocean,
  atmosphere, and land surface.  Other scientific models have been built to process
  very complex, high-dimensional data from instruments such as satellites and radar
  into simpler data products such as images and surface field estimates. These models
  are often computationally intensive.</p>\n<p>Prior to around 2022, the complexity
  of many of these tasks was seen as infeasible for machine learning systems. In the
  years since, deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
  the types of models described above. </p>\n<p>PyEarthTools contains modules for:</p>\n
  <ul>\n<li>Loading and indexing Earth system data into Xarray;</li>\n<li>Processing
  and normalising Earth system data for machine learning;</li>\n<li>Defining machine
  learning (ML) models;</li>\n<li>Training ML models and managing experiments; and</li>\n
  <li>Evaluating ML models.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Come to this talk to learn how to:</p>\n
  <ul>\n<li>Get started with machine learning for Earth system science</li>\n<li>Learn
  about the PyEarthTools framework and how to build re-usable ML pipelines</li>\n
  <li>Catch the science bug and try out some simple projects</li>\n<li>Train your
  own weather models from scratch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This talk is suitable for beginners
  through to professional scientists and data scientists.</p>\n<p>PyEarthTools was
  initially developed by the Bureau of Meteorology (Australia), and now also has developers
  from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (New Zealand), and
  the Met Office (United Kingdom).</p>"
