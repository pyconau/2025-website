abstract: "<p>I work for a local council as an educator and mentor at The Lab - a
  social group for autistic teenagers with an interest in technology. Operating out
  of a makerspace at a public library, we allow participants free use of tools so
  that they can tinker, experiment, and build their skills, both social and technical.
  I see these students gain confidence, discover and ignite new passions, and grow
  their independence. </p>\n<p>It isn't all easy, however. Providing a safe space
  for neurodivergent teens has its challenges. We have had to support participants
  through emotional instability, interpersonal clashes driven by contradicting neurodivergent
  sensitivities like noise and light levels, communication barriers, and more. However,
  with a little patience, when given the right support, we have seen participants
  bloom, stepping out of their comfort zone and sometimes even developing their own
  projects. </p>\n<p>I'll share some reflections on what participants at The Lab do,
  how we structure the sessions, and the considerations we take to foster a neurodivergent-friendly
  learning environment - hopefully this provides you with some insights that can help
  you to improve your pedagogy too. \nI believe that by creating an inclusive environment
  for neurodivergent people, we make it easier to learn for everyone. After all, accessibility
  for one is accessibility for all.</p>"
description: "<p>I'll go through some of the techniques we have used to build trust,
  support our participants, maintain social inclusivity, and inspire the use of technology.
  These methods have been honed by the mentors of The Lab specifically to support
  autistic teenagers, so many of them may help if you have neurodivergent students
  or peers of your own. </p>\n<p>I will be highlighting some features of The Lab that
  differentiate it from school environments, and giving you an insight into some of
  the stories of growth we have seen in participants of our program. These heartwarming
  stories include socially anxious kids making friends, teaching via stealth to empower
  oppositional students with independence, how we flatten the hierarchy to build trust,
  and leaning into having fun to foster collaboration. </p>\n<p>By giving our students
  independence, trust and support, we’ve seen them not only become more confident,
  but - if we’re lucky - sometimes they’ll even work on their own projects too.</p>"
