abstract: <p>Join me for a retrospective on a reusable Django app for providing shared
  database multi-tenancy, complete with automatic tenant-specific queryset filtering,
  automatic tenant selection middleware, REST framework support, and comprehensive
  test coverage. This app, despite its sophistication, was never used in production.
  Let's explore why it was ultimately deemed over-engineered and unnecessary, and
  what lessons we can learn from this experience.</p>
description: <p>I have a story to share about the pitfalls of over-engineering—a project
  that resulted in a powerful yet unused Django library for shared database multi-tenancy.
  This library included automatic tenant-specific querysets, tenant selection middleware,
  REST framework support, and full test coverage across multiple Python and Django
  versions. Despite all of its advanced features and the confidence of complete test
  coverage, it was abandoned before deployment. In this talk, I’ll discuss the journey
  of this project, from its ambitious beginnings to its eventual demise, highlighting
  key lessons learned about scope creep, planning pitfalls, and some of the harsh
  realities of software development.</p>
