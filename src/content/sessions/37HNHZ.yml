abstract: "<p>Shock horror! Banana, the beloved science class Python has been released!
  But how? And more importantly... who did it? The clues are hidden in a collection
  of spreadsheets, but we’ll need something a little more powerful than VLOOKUP to
  solve this slippery case.</p>\n<p>Using Python in Excel (or Jupyter notebooks if
  you prefer!) will help us close the book on the tale of the missing snake while
  sneaking in real-world coding, logic, and data wrangling. Learn about the mystery
  I’ve crafted and how you can get your own students coding with this (or your own)
  data adventure!</p>"
description: "<p>For new coders jumping into an IDE might seem like a big step, but
  could the familiar sight of a spreadsheet help learners get on board?</p>\n<p>In
  this session, I’ll share a snake-themed who-dunnit puzzle I created to help learners
  become confident data detectives. You’ll get a look at the dataset, the step-by-step
  activity, and the Python concepts it covers. Whether you’re teaching teenagers,
  professionals, or coding-curious adults, this activity is all about making Python
  fun, relevant, and just a little bit dramatic.</p>\n<p>Take home my data set or
  get some tips to make up your own so you too can sneak a snake into the sheets for
  your own class.</p>"
