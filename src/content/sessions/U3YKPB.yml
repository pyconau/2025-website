abstract: "<p>The promise of data catalogs, a single source of truth for your organisation's
  data, often clashes with the reality of under-utilised features, redundancy across
  various data catalog solutions across teams, adoption challenges and a lack of clear
  strategy.</p>\n<p>This talk will pose some critical questions concerning current
  approaches of choosing and implementing data catalogs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you actually
  need a Data catalog?</li>\n<li>Are data catalogs becoming just glorified registries
  without much practical use?</li>\n<li>Why do organisations find themselves juggling
  multiple catalogs?</li>\n<li>Is there a synergy between System Catalog &amp; Data
  Catalog?</li>\n<li>How do you identify the right fit and what are the considerations?</li>\n
  <li>How to measure success for a data catalog?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'll dissect the
  reasons behind these challenges and share our experience of implementing data catalogs
  across different organisations.</p>"
