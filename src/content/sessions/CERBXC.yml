abstract: <p>With the current climate crisis and the rise of households growing their
  own fruits, vegetables and herbs, the efficient use of potable water is crucial
  now more than ever. However, the majority of plant watering systems are either manual
  or time based - that is, they water plants on a pre-defined schedule. This talk
  will describe a simple automated watering system programmed with micropython and
  various extensions to the core product to simplify existing features and add new
  capabilities using various internet of things devices and data analytics tools.</p>

  talk will:\n- show Core Electronics' plant_io system that was used to grow alfalfa
  seeds based off soil moisture and give a foundation introduction to the MicroPython
  code,\n- explore some hardware extensions made to the base system to collect further
  environmental data based off additional IoT sensors,\n- describe some other software
  and hardware extensions made to the base system to allow remote monitoring and data
  analysis, and\n- propose directions for future research.</p>\n<p>This talk would
  be of interest to people with an interest in horticulture, Internet of Things devices,
  MicroPython and Raspberry Pi programming as well as data analysts.</p>"
