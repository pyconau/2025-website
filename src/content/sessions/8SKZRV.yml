abstract: "<p>Water quality modeling plays a crucial role in managing aquatic ecosystems.
  Those models are based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the science of using
  numerical analysis and data structures to solve many processes influencing fluid
  behavior. CFD requires many complex mathematical representations through various
  ODE and PDE solvers, and has traditionally been written in Fortran or C++, mostly
  for their speed in doing massively parallel computations, such as handling array
  operations and object-oriented features. As such, those codebases have a long-standing
  legacy in scientific computing, and many established CFD codes are written in them.
  However, as time goes on, we witness the popularity of a new generation of codebases
  such as Python, which stems from its simplicity, versatility, and strong community.
  Extensive libraries and frameworks make Python a popular choice for many developers
  and scientists alike. It is, however, not a preferred language for core CFD code
  due to performance limitations and its difficulties with parallelization. </p>\n
  <p>This talk explores modernizing a <strong>25+ year-old C++ CFD model</strong>,
  essential for <strong>simulating lake conditions</strong>, particularly for <strong>predicting
  temperature variations</strong> and <strong>algal bloom dynamics</strong>, by wrapping
  it with <a href=\"https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/c-interop\">C-interop</a>
  for seamless Python interoperability.  </p>\n<p>Beyond integration, we leverage
  <a href=\"https://optuna.org/\">Optuna</a>, a powerful hyperparameter optimization
  framework, to fine-tune models efficiently, transitioning from manual parameter
  tuning on a laptop to a <strong>distributed, scalable workflow</strong> powered
  by <a href=\"https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/\">Dask Distributed</a> and
  <a href=\"https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">JupyterHub</a>. This transformation
  enables automated hyperparameter optimization across <strong>many lakes in Australia</strong>,
  helping researchers <strong>investigate trends in tuning parameters</strong> and
  derive deeper environmental insights.</p>"
