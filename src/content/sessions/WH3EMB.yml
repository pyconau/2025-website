abstract: "<p>\"In the beginning, the Universe was created. This has made many people
  very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.\" - Douglas Adams</p>\n<p>Computers,
  despite a frankly alarming amount of hype, are not good at nuance. They are usually
  fast, occasionally obedient, and capable of storing quite a lot of cat pictures,
  but when asked to represent something as slippery as \"a person\" or \"Tuesday\"\
  , things begin to get weird.</p>\n<p>Human beings remain the most reliable mediums
  for intepreting reality in a format that can machines can parse. Regrettably, reality
  is complex. We make heavy use of abstractions to handle this complexity, but if
  you ask any seasoned developer about designing systems to handle names, time, geography,
  or a thousand other \"standards\", you will be met with either a thousand-yard stare
  or a wild, keening noise. If no group chat can agree on whether cereal is a soup,
  how can we tell a computer what to do?</p>\n<p>Apart from the difficulty of agreeing
  on categories, reality's refusal to be abstracted neatly can lead to system inaccuracies,
  poor user experiences, security vulnerabilities, and the amplification of social
  harms. But given our industry, our systems of government, and (quite often) our
  sense of self are built on top of the very same kind of abstractions, how can we
  do better in the systems we are responsible for?</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will look
  at some of the most common ways that our systems and data models frequently do not
  match reality, explore approaches to handling reality gracefully, and consider how
  to anticipate flaws in those models and minimise harmful outcomes. This will be
  an introduction to the topic for some, a refresher for others, and possibly a useful
  thing to show that one boss with unrealistic expectations.</p>\n<p>Attendees will
  leave with a better understanding of how and when to make effective use of abstractions
  in systems, and probably an existential headache.</p>"
