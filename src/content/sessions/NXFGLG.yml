abstract: "<p>What do you do when you’ve captured millions of aerial images across
  thousands of kilometers and want to find the handful of problems that could take
  out a state’s power supply? This talk explores how we built a full-stack system
  — combining machine learning, Django, and self hosted infrastructure — to identify
  critical anomalies in Australia’s electricity transmission network. </p>\n<p>You’ll
  learn how we perform image processing at scale, reducing an overwhelming data problem
  into a handful of insights that matter and how we present these results to users.</p>"
description: "<p>Many of Australia’s overhead transmission lines are aging, and targeted
  maintenance is crucial to prevent failures. At scale, this means analysing millions
  of high-resolution images to detect rare and subtle issues. This talk walks through
  a real-world application that uses Machine Learning and Django to turn this data
  problem into something manageable, finding the needles in the haystack.</p>\n<p>We’ll
  look at:\n    •   How aerial inspection imagery is processed using machine learning
  pipelines\n    •   How we host and manage large volumes of images (~400 TB)\n  \
  \  •   The architecture of a Django-based web portal that turns model outputs into
  customer-facing insights\n    •   How we render dashboards, data tables, and generate
  structured PDF reports\n    •   Lessons learned from managing complexity, performance,
  and usability at scale</p>\n<p>This is a practical and technical talk, best suited
  to software engineers, data practitioners, and ML engineers interested in building
  end-to-end systems using Python.</p>"
