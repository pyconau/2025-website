abstract: "<p>Verifying, evaluating or interpreting complex data requires specialist
  tools and methods. Many data scientists, programmers and scientists will be familiar
  with some evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error or true positive
  rate. There are many situations where these scores are insufficient for assessing
  correctness, accuracy or suitability of a model or prediction. The challenge of
  verifying models and predictions affects most fields of science, engineering, and
  many machine learning applications.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce \"scores\"
  , an open source Python package for verifying and evaluating labelled, n-dimensional
  (multidimensional) data at any scale. \"scores\" includes over 50 metrics, statistical
  techniques and data processing tools. The software repository can be found at https://github.com/nci/scores
  and the documentation can be found at https://scores.readthedocs.io/ .</p>\n<p>This
  talk is suitable for beginner, intermediate and expert audiences. Developers and
  data scientists who are familiar mainly with tabular data, such as supported by
  the pandas library, may be interested in the additional functionality offered by
  \"scores\" (and the xarray library it utilises). For those learning about more advanced
  methods, every metric and statistical test has a companion Jupyter Notebook tutorial.
  For expert users already familiar with these ideas, you may be interested in some
  of the novel scoring methods not commonly found in other packages. </p>\n<p>Come
  to this talk to hear about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference between tabular data,
  n-dimensional data, and labelled n-dimensional data</li>\n<li>Examples of using
  a common metric from \"scores\" on labelled, n-dimensional data</li>\n<li>Examples
  of using \"scores\" for interrogating data in multiple dimensions</li>\n<li>Examples
  of where basic methods overlook important considerations</li>\n<li>Examples of using
  some of the more complex metrics in \"scores\"</li>\n</ul>"
