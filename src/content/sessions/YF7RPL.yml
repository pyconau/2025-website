abstract: <p>A system that applies machine learning to make UI tests more resilient
  by automatically detecting and fixing broken selectors, reducing rework and increasing
  test stability.</p>
description: "<p>Broken selectors are one of the leading causes of instability in
  UI test suites. Even minor interface changes — like renaming an attribute or moving
  a component — can break automated tests, leading to false negatives, increased maintenance
  effort, and frustration for teams. This kind of fragility slows down CI/CD pipelines
  and undermines confidence in test automation as a reliable safety net during software
  delivery.</p>\n<p>This talk presents the design and development of a self-healing
  system for UI tests that leverages machine learning to make test suites smarter
  and more resilient. I’ll walk through the key ideas, the motivation behind building
  such a system, and the main technical challenges encountered during its development.
  The presentation will cover how this approach helps tests automatically adapt to
  UI changes, reduces manual rework, and improves the flow of continuous integration
  and delivery.</p>\n<p>Attendees will leave with insights into how machine learning
  can strengthen test automation, inspiration to enhance their own frameworks, and
  a deeper understanding of what’s possible when combining ML with UI testing.</p>"
