abstract: "<p>Kraken Technologies ships over 100 versions of code per day across 25
  environments in more than 10 countries with new versions being kicked off to deploy
  upon merge into master.</p>\n<p>We want to be able to run jobs across all of our
  various environments without slowing down developers (by blocking deployments) or
  having an impact on clients during their operating hours (outages or performance
  degradation). </p>\n<p>But how do you run jobs out of hours when there are no time
  zones that are out of hours for everyone? In this talk, I will introduce the Housekeeping
  Framework, our internal solution to this problem.</p>"
description: "<p>The Housekeeping Framework was developed with the aim to allow developers
  to:\n- Easily deploy code that runs across all environments\n- Specify only certain
  hours it can run in (in the local time of its environment)\n- Easily see when the
  status of a job changes\n- Not require manual changes across 25+ environments</p>\n
  <p>This talk will present the context that the housekeeping framework was developed
  within, then dig into how the framework was structured and developed using Python.
  Additionally, we will reflect on the experience of writing a framework and how important
  \"developer friendly\" tooling has been in encouraging adoption of the Housekeeping
  Framework within Kraken.</p>"
