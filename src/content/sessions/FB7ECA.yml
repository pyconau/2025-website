abstract: <p>Python has match statements now. What are they? Why are they? How do
  they work? Discovering the true power of Python's structural pattern matching has
  made my classes more powerful than ever! Want to learn this power? Then come to
  my talk! It promises to inform, engage and entertain with real world  worked examples,
  arcane facts, and interactive questions.</p>
description: <p>Most of the Python devs I know just don't get the match statement.
  They're great at ifs. They know their elses. Surely the match statement is just
  those butâ€¦ rearranged a bit? I thought like this once. But then I saw the light!
  Have you ever been working in a project with a dozen different classes, each with
  eighteen different attributes and fifteen different methods? No? Just me? Well you
  can check all of those in a single match statement, with no ands in sight, and with
  easy readability! Don't believe me? Come and be amazed! This talk will be accessible
  to novices and still interesting for the more experienced.</p>
