abstract: "<p>Time is one of the few forces that remain outside of human control.
  Attempting to understand it is hard enough, but attempting to make computers understand
  it is a frequent and common source of errors, especially across different cultures
  and calendars.</p>\n<p>This talk will explore a number of different ways of understanding
  and expressing the flow of time, as well as common and uncommon edge cases to account
  for when building software.</p>"
description: "<p>This talk will occur at a specific location - that is usually easy
  enough to understand - and also at a specific time and date. What that time and
  date actually means is part of a large and complex system of rules and exceptions
  and changes, which is also only understood by specific cultures or valid in specific
  regions.</p>\n<p>These systems can appear to be simple, but failing to get it right
  can result in anything from cultural insensitivity to a full-on systems failure.</p>\n
  <p>Join us for a look at time itself, in which we will:\n- try to understand what
  this \"time\" thing actually is\n- explore different ways that time is represented
  and communicated\n- understand different calendar systems and how they interact\n
  - learn how to build more resilient and culturally sensitive computer systems</p>"
