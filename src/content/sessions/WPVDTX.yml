abstract: "<p>When you're running a web service used by customers or running a daily
  data pipeline, you need a way to know if it's working. One option is to wait until
  users start flooding your support system or someone idly comments that the data
  seems old and you realise your data pipeline hasn't worked for a week. Another option
  is to have your code tell some central system whether things are working or not
  and then make pretty graphs out of it, and potentially wake someone up if things
  are bad enough. Having the machines automatically tell you if things are wrong rather
  than waiting for the humans is generally preferable.</p>\n<p>This talk will be a
  beginner to intermediate introduction to observability and to OpenTelemetry, a vendor-agnostic
  collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools for observability. I will answer questions like:</p>\n
  <ol>\n<li>What do you mean by telemetry? What are metrics, logs and traces and when
  would I use each?</li>\n<li>What's OpenTelemetry? What does it give you out of the
  box? How do all the pieces fit together?</li>\n<li>Okay, I want to spin this thing
  up, what do I need to know?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will also cover some of the business
  goals that can be achieved by using OpenTelemetry, eg standardised tagging, scrubbing
  PII and cost attribution.</p>"
