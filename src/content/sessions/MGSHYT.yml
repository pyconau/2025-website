abstract: <p>If there's anything that AI is known for, it's not speed. Other than
  throw more GPU's at the problem, what can you do to make AI models run faster? In
  this talk, you'll learn about AI model performance, what impacts it and what you
  can do to improve it.</p>
description: "<p>This talk is for developers working with or building AI models. In
  this talk, you'll learn about what impacts the performance of AI and how to think
  about your requirements for speed versus quality.\nAfter attending this talk, you'll
  know how to benchmark AI models and understand more about configuring models and
  picking the right model for the job. \nThis talk is not target at AI/ML experts,
  we will cover some newer technical concepts like semantic model routing but it will
