abstract: "<p>EVs are transforming transport, while Australia has unique resilience
  requirements for our beloved road trips. Could I build an app with data &amp; AI
  to help more Aussies electrify their rides?</p>\n<p>Come on a journey through operations
  research, spatial data, graphs and more, prototyping with python, streamlit and
  a host of useful libraries and open data services. Follow the winding road of development
  as we encounter and resolve challenges.</p>\n<p>We'll also explore the applicability
  of this approach to related problems in EV network and fleet planning. I hope you'll
  leave full of charge for your next data-driven adventure.</p>"

  <p>This talk will set the scene and tell the overall story of development, but can
  also go the extra mile and read about the development process at https://safetydave.net/category/electric-vehicles/</p>"
