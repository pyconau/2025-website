abstract: "<p>Have you ever wondered if life would be better with a robot scorpion
  by your side? Now’s your chance to find out! Meet Pinchy — a Raspberry Pi-powered,
  fully autonomous, and undeniably eye-catching robot companion.</p>\n<p>In this talk,
  you’ll learn how Pinchy maps its environment and navigates with ease using SLAM
  algorithms and computer vision. We’ll also dive into the efficient design inspired
  by real scorpions, blending biology with engineering.</p>\n<p>Whether you're into
  robotics, Python, or just want to see a cool scorpion skitter across the stage,
  come say hi to Pinchy this PyCon!</p>"
description: "<p>I'm currently still in high school, but I discovered my passion for
  robotics early on in my tech journey. When I first got my hands on a robotics kit,
  I surprised myself by putting down my phone just to keep working on my project outside
  of class — which, at the time, felt like a major breakthrough.</p>\n<p>That spark
  turned into a full-blown obsession. Over the past two years, I’ve spent more than
  700 hours developing my own robot companion: Pinchy. Along the way, I’ve gone through
  countless prototypes and design revisions — starting with foam-core legs and evolving
  into a fully custom 3D-printed chassis modeled after a real scorpion.</p>\n<p>In
  this talk, I’ll walk you through the journey of building Pinchy — from design challenges
  to unexpected breakthroughs — and dive into the technical details behind its fully
  autonomous navigation using Computer Vision and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization
  and Mapping). I’ll cover how it perceives and maps its environment, how its walking
  gait is controlled, and how all the systems come together on a Raspberry Pi platform.
  We’ll finish with a look at what’s next — including my future plans to take over
  the world, one robot scorpion at a time.</p>"
