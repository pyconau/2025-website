abstract: <p>AI systems increasingly make life-changing decisions about healthcare,
  employment, criminal justice, and financial services, but often perpetuate systemic
  discrimination against marginalized communities. Through real-world examples this
  talk examines how bias enters AI through biased data, algorithmic design, and deployment
  feedback loops. Attendees will learn a practical three-phase framework for building
  anti-oppressive AI systems and leave with concrete tools for identifying bias, implementing
  fairness metrics, and advocating for ethical AI practices in their organizations.</p>
