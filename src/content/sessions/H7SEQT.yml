abstract: "<p>After a number of my Year 10 students entered a capture the flag cybersecurity
  competition they had a sudden burst of enthusiasm for the topic. Networking and
  cybersecurity, being parts of the national curriculum, are things that I should
  probably be teaching anyway so when it came to delivering this unit I figured I'd
  capture their enthusiam by running my assessment as a capture the flag. This seemed
  like a good idea at the time, but as it turns out CTFs take quite a bit of effort
  - and getting a system like the micro:bit to reliably immitate a network a bit of
  work. Also creating a scenario where students don't just troll each other in the
  middle of an exam when... also figuring out how to stop them cheating when their
  communication is open... also figuring out a way to teach them everything they needed
  to know in order to even approach the task... also how do I learn all this stuff
  first?</p>\n<p>Join me as I go through the five weeks I spent learning, delivering
  and then assessing cybersecruity things.\nI'll be overviewing what I had to teach
  to get them ready, what I had to code on the micro:bits to make any of this work,
  and ultimately ask: how effective is it to run a capture the flag using Micro:bits.</p>"
