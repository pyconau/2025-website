abstract: <p>Wi-Fi, the mysterious computer blabber. Have you ever wondered how are
  computers yapping away from under our noses? What secrets must they hold? In this
  talk we will cover the magic of Wi-Fi, how it works in detail and we will even get
  our own wireless communication system going using Python and micro-controllers.</p>
description: "<p>Wi-Fi systems are complicated beasts with several layers, each solving
  a little piece of the overall wireless communication puzzle.</p>\n<p>At the most
  basic level, there are radio frequency transmitters and receivers. Transmitters
  are little lights that can be turned on and off at several different colors and
  intensities, but with frequencies so low our eyes can't see. Conversely, receivers
  are just little 360° cameras, that like our eyes can only see a small spectrum of
  colors, but again in colors we can't see.</p>\n<p>On top of that, if two computers
  want to communicate they must plot and agree upon a common scheme for how to blink
  their own lights, and how to change their colors and intensities so that they know
  what each other mean when they see specific light patterns. This is not unlike Morse
  code, but using more ways of conveying information other than just short and long
  blinks.</p>\n<p>Even though that forms the basis of being able to communicate, there
  are still several other layers on top, since the scheming computers must also agree
  on things such as to when to turn off their transmitters so their cameras are not
  blinded by their own lights as they are trying to listen to their peers, how to
  identify to whom the messages are going if there are multiple peers, how to secretly
  encode messages such that only peers in the same network can see it, and how to
  deliver messages from and to the Internet.</p>\n<p>Using Python and RP2040 microcontrollers,
  we can build little lights and cameras and implement a fully working version of
  a wireless communication system, with the extra benefit we can actually watch the
  lights and see what it looks like when computers are talking.</p>"
