abstract: "<p>Sick of writing lots of dedicated methods to perform the same tasks?
  Want to write less code? This talk may be for you! </p>\n<p>REST API's are ubiquitious,
  and a very useful way to send and recieve data from various services. However, building
  them can often feel repetitive and boring. So, because I was lazy, and sick of doing
  it I decided to override specific dunder methods to write less boiler plate code,
  and keep myself interested.</p>\n<p>Was it easier? Probably not. Did it require
  less work than a normal implementation? Also probably not. Did it make my code more
  readable and portable? Definitely not. But it was fun, and I learnt how overriding
  Python's magic methods - often called dunders - could be useful. Let me share the
  lessons I learnt with you and inspire your own ideas.</p>"
description: "<p>Early in my Python learning journey I was having to rapidly prototype
  and implement REST clients for grabbing information. Bored of writing what felt
  like the same code over and over again, I wanted a more interesting way of solving
  the problem.</p>\n<p>Curious about pythons error handling, and knowing little about
  magic methods beyond <code>__init__()</code>, I stumbled across ways to manipulate
  attribute access and creation. Spending far to much time diving deeper, I learned
  how to query REST endpoints without having to define a dedicated method for each
  call.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can all learn from my abilility to overcomplicate even
  the simplest tasks. Aimed at users who want to explore class customisation, those
  who want to add some new problem solving tools to their belt, or anyone wanting
  to hear how overcomplicating problems can be one of the best learning tools. </p>\n
  <p>We will touch on:\n- What are magic methods, and how you can start using them.\n
  - Why reading the Python reference documentation is useful.\n- How to deal with
  undefined class attributes.\n- Creating and implementing callable objects.</p>\n
  <p>While the story and example focus on building a REST client, the concepts presented
  can be applied to many problems.</p>"
