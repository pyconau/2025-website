abstract: <p>One of the big features added in Python 3.13 is Tier 3 support for iOS
  and Android as platforms. This means you can now run Python code that uses the standard
  library on mobile devices without modification. However, most interesting projects
  also use code from PyPI... so how do you get <em>that</em> code to run on iOS and
  Android? How do you even produce a wheel in the first place?</p>
description: "<p>In this talk, you'll learn about the eccentricities of iOS and Android
  as Python platforms, and what is involved in generating Python wheels that can be
  used for iOS and Android. You'll be introduced to cibuildwheel, a tool that can
  dramatically simplify the process of building wheels; and how to configure cibuildwheel
  to build iOS and Android wheels. Lastly, you'll be shown how to add these wheels
  to your own projects while you wait for official versions to be published.</p>\n
  <p>Although this talk is presented primarily for the benefit of people who may want
  to add iOS and Android Python support to a package, it also serves as an introduction
  (or refresher on recent changes in standards) to Python packaging for desktop platforms.</p>"
