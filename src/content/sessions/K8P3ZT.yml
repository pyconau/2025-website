abstract: "<p>There is a lot of hype swirling around about AI coding. But there are
  many sceptical developers who have tried AI coding tools and found them rubbish.</p>\n
  <p>This talk aims to move beyond the hype and focus on AI coding best practices
  as technology stands today. These tips are applicable for developers who write code
  everyday and people who havenâ€™t written a single line of code. Don't expect to become
  a 10x developer overnight. But with the right habits, you might get 10% more productive
  and a lot less frustrated.</p>\n<p>Note this talk will focus on using CLI-based
  coding agents (e.g. Claude Code), rather than AI auto-completers in IDEs (e.g. GitHub
  Copilot, Cursor).</p>"
