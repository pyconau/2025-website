abstract: <p>The Data &amp; AI specialist track is all about the technology, skills,
  and practices that engineers, data scientists, and researchers need when building
  effective and reliable solutions that involve data and leverage different flavours
  of machine learning and automation. We’re excited to hear talks that cover a wide
  range of topics relating to data science, data engineering, ML engineering, and
  modern artificial intelligence.</p>
description: "<p>At the end of the day we’ll recap our highlights, insights and key
  takeaways. The track ‘close’ helps us tie a ribbon around our full program of talks.
  We’ll see where the conversation takes us, and will conclude at or before 5:40pm.</p>\n
  <p>But wait! As one door closes (on the specialist tracks) another one opens! Stick
  around at PyCon AU for the main conference on Saturday and Sunday!</p>"
