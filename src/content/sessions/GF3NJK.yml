abstract: "<p>Software builders and operators have long looked to transport and aviation
  for lessons in engineering practices and safety. Today, we’ll turn our attention
  to the railways as we take 20 years of hindsight to look at the ‘Broady runaway’
  and what it can teach us. This talk will dive into the ATSB’s subsequent safety
  investigation, recommendations and parallels in the software world, offering us
  critical lessons in complex system design and incident management.</p>\n<p>For software
  engineers, architects, managers and executives this is an opportunity for us to
  reflect and learn from the past so that we can build more resilient and easier to
  operate platforms in the future.</p>\n<p>Our runaway train is a 3 car electrical
  multiple unit (EMU) that, in 2003, did the full 17km Broadmeadows to Spencer st
  run in just 16 minutes, famously without a driver on board. The cause of the runaway
  and resulting collision with a stationary diesel locomotive has been the talk of
  many rail enthusiasts ever since, especially since there were no fatalities or serious
  injuries.</p>"
