abstract: "<p>Designing for inclusion isn’t about ticking boxes, avoiding lawsuits,
  or expanding markets—it’s about people. True inclusion starts with the individuals
  we meet and the stories we choose to share.</p>\n<p>My journey into digital accessibility
  has been deeply personal—shaped by my Dad, who was blind, navigating a world that
  too often overlooks people like him.</p>\n<p>As the designers and builders of today’s
  digital society, we have the power—and responsibility—to make everyone feel welcome.
  This talk explores how storytelling and small, intentional design decisions can
  spark more inclusive experiences, both at work and in the world around us.</p>"
