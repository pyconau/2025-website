abstract: "<p>With the arrival of large language models and the generative tools built
  on them we have seen a huge increase in pressure to use these tools in our work.</p>\n
  <p>This worries me, but it's hard to easily explain why.</p>\n<p>Am I being paranoid?
  Or just overly opposed to a change that's inevitable? Is it just... a skill issue?</p>\n
  <p>I invite you to listen to me dig through the history of the relationship between
  automation, technology, and work to try to unpack my feelings on where our industry
  is headed.</p>"
description: "<p>I'm often the one advocating <em>for</em> change in a given environment
  so it's always a bit of an interesting moment for me when I realise I'm dead against
  some kind of new hotness. This often triggers a lot of introspection and trying
  to work out what about it has got my back up.</p>\n<p>Generative tools built on
  large language models are fascinating things but the ways in which we're being encouraged
  to use them, both by employers and by peers, give me the heebies. This presentation
  is an encapsulation of the thinking I did as to why they do that.</p>\n<p>We'll
  be covering all kinds of stuff from the Luddites, to the globalisation of manufacturing,
  to the nature of creative work in general. I can't promise a conclusion that will
  be meaningful for everyone, but I can at least promise an explanation of how I came
  to mine.</p>"
