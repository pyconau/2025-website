abstract: "<p>Teaching is a demanding job that takes away the initiative to learn
  or improve in programming skills. I therefore decided to streamline some of my assignment
  marking using Python. The time I spent in developing the Python scripts could then
  be offset by the efficiency and accuracy I gained from the automation. </p>\n<p>In
  this presentation, I will demonstrate how to populate student details into their
  individual Excel mark sheets, check marking mistakes, automate mark adjustment and
  collect data from individual mark sheets. </p>\n<p>While the above automation can
  be achieved using standard tools offered by Microsoft by putting the programming
  logic into Excel formulae or Visual Basic for Application, I will argue using Python
  to separate the logic from data is a better approach in terms of programming practice
  and Cybersecurity.</p>"
description: "<p>This talk is suitable for Python beginners and the set of Python
  scripts to automate assignment marking was developed in 2020 when I was teaching
  at the Hong Kong Baptist University. Each student was marked using standard assessment
  rubrics stored in an Excel spreadsheet. All the marks of a class of students are
  then stored in a folder of Excel files. I will demonstrate the automation of the
  following actions using Python libraries related to Excel such as openpyxl and xlwings.</p>\n
  <p>-Create individual student mark sheets with names and other details filled in\n
  -Check marking mistakes such as missing marks or giving marks above the highest
  score\n-Adjustment of marks in all mark sheets due to errors made in assignment
  design, etc.\n-Collect marks from each individual Excel mark sheet\n-Export Excel
  mark sheets to PDF format for archive purposes</p>\n<p>I will also compare the benefits
  of automating Excel using Python with Excel formulae and Visual Basic for Application
  by separating programming logic from data. Especially in the light of the Government
  Cybersecurity initiative \"Essential Eight Maturity Model\", Visual Basic for Application
  should be avoided and Python can be a viable solution.</p>"
