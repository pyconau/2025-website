abstract: "<p>Clinical data harmonisation efforts are an extraordinarily powerful
  tool in the world of observational research. When your data model is designed to
  do everything, however, there is a necessary trade-off in design principles. The
  requirement to support every possible use-case across all clinical domains means
  that they can tend to favour flexibility over clarity, storing events, measurements,
  treatments, and outcomes in highly normalised, loosely typed schemas. For domain
  experts like oncology researchers or clinicians, this makes even basic questions
  (say, “what happened to this patient, when, and why?”) frustratingly opaque.</p>\n
  <p>Using Python’s ORM paradigm, we created a more intuitive, opinionated view of
  oncology data. By surfacing richly connected objects like CancerPatient, CancerDiagnosis,
  Regimen, or Cycle, we move away from brittle SQL scripts and toward a model that
  reflects how clinical experts already think. These ORM-backed tools not only support
  reproducible ETL and visualisation workflows, but also allow non-developers to explore
  complex patient journeys in a hands-on, object-based way. We’re building out a library
  of reusable object maps that encode domain knowledge directly, letting researchers
  focus on clinical questions and not worry about the nuanced query logic.</p>"
