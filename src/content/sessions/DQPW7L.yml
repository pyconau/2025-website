abstract: <p>Adding file system specific information (e.g. how to match case, whether
  to follow symlinks) to pathlib Path objects, instead of adding such arguments to
  methods taking Path objects.</p>
description: "<p>Pathlib has become the de facto standard to pass file system paths\n
  around, which is kinda weird as the only real thing it's going go for\nit is a tiny
  bit of syntactic sugar.</p>\n<p>Paths are a bit of an odd duck, as their literal
  form is very close to\ntheir object form.</p>\n<p>But there are extra bits of context
  around a path that matter, such as\nfollowing symlinks, and junctions, how to handle
  case when matching\nfile names.</p>\n<p>I became interested in the idea of embedding
  some of this knowledge\ninside the path object, and seeing if that led to a clean
  up of the\nAPI, can we avoid having all these file system, implementation\nspecific
  flags in our API, and instead encapsulate them within our\npath objects?</p>\n<p>A
  lot of work has been done in the last few releases to make pathlib\nextensible,
  so that paves the way for trying API experiments like\nthis.</p>\n<p>Often when
  you get an idea, it rattles around in the brain like a\nbuzzing bee. With Python
  you can throw it up on the \"ideas\" forum and\nget it shot down quickly.</p>\n
  <p>Or Not..</p>"
