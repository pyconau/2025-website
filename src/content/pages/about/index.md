# About the conference

PyCon AU 2025 will be held from Friday 12th to Tuesday 16th September at Pullman Melbourne on the Park, in Narrm/Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

If you're new to our event, you might also want to read about [the culture of PyCon AU](/about/culture/).

## Specialist tracks

The first day of PyCon AU will be dedicated to specialist tracks. These tracks, also known as ‘miniconfs’, are curated by smaller specialist groups within Python community, and allowed for more in-depth talks on the subject.

PyCon AU kicks off with a day for attendees interested in specialist fields. It runs just like a main conference day, any attendees on this day are welcome to attend talks from any or all of the tracks, you can pick and choose and the talk schedules will line up nicely to let you do that.

Each track is organised by specialists in their field, the talks are selected by the track organisers in coordination with the program committee.

## Conference main track

This is the core of PyCon AU, as each day kicks off one of our amazing keynote speakers, followed by breakout tracks of talks on a diverse range of Python related topics. There will be a mix of beginner friendly and advanced talks on both technical and non-technical topics, and with multiple tracks there’ll always be something you’re interested to see.

The end of the day brings everyone together again for a hilarious and informative round of lightning talks (submission of lightning talks topics will be open during the conference).

## Development sprints and social events

Python wouldn’t have gotten to where it is without a welcoming community of developers building cool things together. The development sprints are an open space for people to work on projects with a particular focus on open source projects.

The sprints are a place for everyone, from experienced open source contributors, to interested first-time contributors, and anyone really! Maybe you want to hang out and try out an idea you have, maybe you’d like to find collaborators for a project you want to start, maybe you’d like someone to help you through your first attempts at open source. We’ll provide tables, chairs, wifi, power and a community of supportive developers.

## About PyCon AU

PyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.

PyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.

## We are independent and not-for-profit

PyCon AU is a labour of love, run independently of commercial interests by an all-volunteer team. The legal and financial structure is provided by Linux Australia Inc., a not-for-profit body registered under the _Associations Incorporation Act (NSW) 2009_.

We also operate our program selection and sponsorship processes with a very strict "editorial firewall". Sponsors and other commercial organisations don't get a say in what talks we select or other editorial decisions we make, none of the talks on our program paid money to be there, and anything that happens on our stages that _does_ come from a sponsor is clearly communicated as such.

All of this lets us run an engaging, high-quality event, while offering ticket prices far more accessible than many other commercial events of a similar size.
