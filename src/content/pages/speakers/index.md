# Things all presenters should know 

## Talk Duration

**All talks run for half an hour (30 minutes)*, including questions. **

It is your choice whether to allow time for questions inside your time slot. Often, speakers who choose to take questions will allow 5 minutes for questions.

However, you can decide how you would like to handle questions about your talk. By default, Session Chairs will assume you are **not** taking questions. Please tell your Session Chair what your preferences are.

You have two choices for taking questions for your talk:


* **No questions** - (default) you can use the whole 30 minutes for your talk. If people have questions they can find you afterwards.
* **Curated questions **- your Session Chair will stand next to the microphone and moderate questions (e.g. by stepping in if someone makes a comment instead of asking a question), including passing the microphone to audience members.

Your Session Chair will sit in the front row and give you time warning cards at 5, 2, and 1 minutes remaining, and STOP when you have hit your time (e.g. at 25 minutes if you want 5 minutes for questions). Please speak with your Session Chair before your talk about any preferences you have.

There are 10 minutes between talks for changeover. Please respect this time limit. Once your slot is over, please collect your things and continue any conversations in the hallway, in order to give the next speaker an equal chance to prepare.

* We have a single flash talk of 5 minutes as part of the Scientific Python Specialist Track this year - this talk is part of the academic publishing process we trialed this year. More information about that is [here](https://2024.pycon.org.au/attend/academic-publication/).

## Slide Tips

Here are some suggestions for slide design that will help you avoid a few common disappointing situations that presenters can face. (We thank previous PyCon AU organisers for this helpful list).

* Ensure that text isn’t too close to the borders or sides of your slides
    * Projectors have a tendency to cut the sides of your slides!
        * Avoid highly indented bullet points
            * It’s a sign you’re overloading the slide.
            * With too much information.
                * Which can get frustrating
* Ensure that text is large enough to be readable at a distance (> 18 point is usually a good guide). If you can read your slide in the thumbnail preview, that is a good sign.
* Projectors - compared to screens - often have **very poor** contrast. Just because it looks good on your computer screen doesn't mean it will look good on the projector. Avoid too many fancy colours - just keep it simple.
* Use high contrast colour schemes. White on black is good, blue on white is good, pink on purple is terrible.
* Many people have problems with seeing low contrast colours and images. Please also try to consider colour-blind people when picking colours.
* Spellcheck your presentation.

More helpful hints can be found in the Writing Slides section of [VM Brasseur’s Public Speaking Resources](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking#writing-presentations).

## Conduct and Expectations

Please ensure your talk content and slides comply with our [code of conduct](https://2024.pycon.org.au/safety/). This includes your own behaviour as well as anything you endorse or encourage.

In particular:

* Don't include content where you attack or pentest conference networks, conference infrastructure, conference processes, or conference attendees, in any way.
* If you are talking about past hacks or social engineering, you must have had informed consent for any system or person affected, and you must clearly indicate that this was the case.
* If you're not sure whether something you want to present complies with the code of conduct, or you want more information, contact [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

Any actions that make attendees feel unwelcome or unsafe fall under the Code of Conduct. There's more information on our [Code of Conduct page](https://2024.pycon.org.au/safety/).

## Content warnings

If your talk contains content that you think might be sensitive, distressing or traumatic to some people (even if most people will be fine with it) please add a content warning, which you can do by [editing your accepted talk proposal in Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2024/me/submissions/).

Content warnings aren't a moral judgement on your talk, and they won't restrict who is able to watch it. In fact, the opposite is true—for some of your audience members, if they know something they find distressing is coming up, they'll be better able to handle it than if it's a surprise. That lets them look after their mental health and better engage with and learn from your talk!

Some examples of content warnings:

* This talk contains extensive discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout.
* This talk contains images and brief mentions of bushfires and other natural disasters.

**Content warnings don't exempt you from the code of conduct. **Instead, content warnings are used for things that comply with the code of conduct, but might be distressing to some people.

## Talk Recording

Your talk will be recorded, unless you have opted out of the recording release in your talk proposal form. All recorded talks will be available on the PyCon Australia YouTube channel shortly after the event: [https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU).

The talks will also be uploaded to the Linux Australia mirror, at [https://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/](https://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/)

We will publish these talks under a [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licence.

## Your Published Talk Details

Your talk information and biography is [up on our website](https://2024.pycon.org.au/program/).

Please take the time to look over your talk entry, and make sure that you are happy with your abstract and biography.

Should you wish to update your biography, profile photo, or abstract, please email any changes to [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au) from the same email address you used to submit your talk, or register for the conference. (We are using this email to contact you right now.)

We advise you to send through any changes as soon as possible, ahead of the event, as the organising team will be very busy during the event and will not have time to push website changes outside of egregious errors or emergencies.

## What To Do If Something Comes Up

Sometimes things happen! Laptops run out of power, slides go missing, transport runs late, family stuff comes up, physical or mental health problems can occur. If anything comes up at any point, please let Maia and Elena (our Program Chairs) or one of the other conference organisers know. We have an experienced organising team who can help with a broad range of questions, issues, or concerns. The sooner you let us know if there is a problem, the sooner we can work with you to achieve the best possible outcome.

If you’re just unsure and need to clarify something, use the Attendee Discord (details to come) or email [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

If you are having an urgent problem relating to conference logistics, please contact us. A 24-hour hotline number will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues can be directed to a Volunteer, A/V Team member, or Organiser, as appropriate.

If you have an issue that should involve our Conduct Team, you can contact a member of the safety team via a 24-hour hotline number that will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues of Conduct can be emailed to [safety@pycon.org.au](mailto:safety@pycon.org.au). Signs with these details will be around the venue. 

If you have an immediate safety concern, please contact venue Security, or Emergency Services (000). If you do call Emergency Services, remember to let venue security know as well.


# Presenting

Please note PyCon AU 2024 is an in-person event only, we cannot accommodate remote presentations. 

## What should I wear?

PyCon AU has no formal dress code, with the exception that you can’t wear things that violate our Code of Conduct.

Some speakers choose to wear something casual that they feel comfortable in, others choose to wear something formal, yet others choose to wear something attention-grabbing and vivid that expresses who they are. All of those choices are valid and encouraged!

However, we use over-ear (or DPA) microphones, which are small microphones which fit around your ear, attached to a “beltpack” (which contains a battery and transmitter) via a cable. Because of this:

* You need somewhere to put the “beltpack”, like a belt or a pocket. **This is particularly important if you’re wearing a dress or skirt or an outfit without pockets.**
* You need to be able to put on and take off the microphone comfortably in public. (We can route the cable over or under clothing, and you can put the microphone on yourself with our AV team’s guidance, but we don’t have dressing rooms for you to “mic up” in.)

## Display Resolution

We use a **16:9 ratio** on all displays with 1080p resolution (1920 x 1080).

## Video Connections

You will present from your own laptop; we do not collect slides to load onto a lectern computer (if this is not possible, let us know in advance).  You will have a confidence monitor but it will display what is on the projector, not your speaker notes (if you have them, they will display on your laptop screen).

**All** rooms will **only** have HDMI connectors. If you need an adapter to output HDMI, **please bring it with you (especially if you are a Mac user and/or need USB-C connectors)**. We strongly recommend you bring the power adapter for your device, too.

There will also be an audio connector (3.5mm headphone/mini-jack). If you are intending on playing audio, please let the A/V team know when setting up for your talk so they can test sound levels before you start.

If you have special requirements beyond this, please get in touch in advance with Ryan, the AV team lead, on [ryan@nextdayvideo.com.au](mailto:ryan@nextdayvideo.com.au).

## Testing Your Laptop

**It is recommended that you test your laptop before your talk.** A test setup will be available in the AV room, which is Organiser Office 6. This will be similar to the podium setup, allowing you to plug your laptop in and check that it works for video and audio. You can find this room on the Northern Concourse, opposite Entrance Door 15, near the main entrance to the venue. It will be marked on the venue map, which will be on the event website closer to the event. A helpful volunteer can direct you if you become lost.

## Arrive Early

Please make sure you know when and where your talk is scheduled. Please check the [schedule](https://2024.pycon.org.au/program/) to confirm the day, time, and room for which your talk is scheduled. **Please note previous emails indicated your talk time in ACDT (Adelaide time) instead of AEDT (Melbourne time) (oops!).**

We have just made a round of final schedule changes and will not be making any more= unless absolutely necessary. If any changes affect you, we will let you know as soon as possible. Again, if you have concerns or need to change something, please contact us at [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au)** **as soon as possible.

**It is essential that you arrive in your talk room in the break before your talk** to ‘check in’ with and meet your Session Chair and A/V team. This will give you time to look at the layout of your room, assess the space, etc.
