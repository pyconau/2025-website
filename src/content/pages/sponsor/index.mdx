PyCon AU 2025 is an annual conference dedicated to the Python programming language and its ecosystem. The conference brings together Python developers, enthusiasts, and industry professionals from around Australia and the world for three days of talks, tutorials, and networking opportunities, with two days of additional programming sprints focused on practical open source development.

As a sponsor, you will have the opportunity to showcase your company and products to a highly engaged audience of Python developers, data scientists, educators, and open-source advocates. Your support will not only contribute to the success of the conference but also to the growth and development of the Python community in Australia and beyond.

In addition to the benefits of exposure and brand recognition, sponsoring PyCon AU 2025 will provide your company with the opportunity to recruit top talent, demonstrate thought leadership, and build relationships with potential customers and partners. We offer a range of sponsorship packages and can work with you to tailor a package that meets your specific needs and objectives.
