## About volunteering for PyCon AU 2025

PyCon AU is a grass-roots, community-driven event. It needs bright, enthusiastic people - like you - to make it a success!

Volunteering at PyCon AU is a great opportunity, and can be deeply rewarding. On a more practical note, volunteering at PyCon AU can add to your professional portfolio in many ways - making this an ideal opportunity for students or recent graduates.



## You will...

- Meet exceptional people - many of whom are recognised experts in their field and industry luminaries
- Get great networking opportunities with people working in the Python and open source community
- Gain practical, hands-on experience and skills in event management, customer liaison, public relations and operation of audio visual equipment - which are invaluable to future employers

## What’s required of me?

We’re looking for

- people who can help out for a majority of the conference, working in roles such as AV or the Registration desk, in exchange for a free ticket to the event
- people who can help out only a little for ad-hoc tasks, but understand that they need to have their own ticket for the event.

## What’s in it for me?

If you can help out for a majority of the conference, we’ll give you a volunteer ticket!

Aside from that, all volunteers get:

- Warm and fuzzy feelings
- A hearty round of applause at the conference close as we invite you on stage to thank you for your efforts
- Written reference covering your experience and duties - useful for job interviews!
- Refunds of expenses you incur in the course of volunteering (e.g. parking costs if asked to help logistically, etc)

## What you need to know.

PyCon AU operates under a clear [Code of Conduct](/safety) and we ask that all volunteers exemplify this during their time volunteering during the conference. All attendees (including volunteers, organisers, speakers and attendees) are bound by this Code of Conduct as part of registering to attend.
