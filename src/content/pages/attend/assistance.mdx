# Financial Assistance

Thanks to the support of our sponsors, we have budget set aside for providing financial assistance to PyCon AU speakers who might otherwise find it difficult to attend.

Financial assistance grants take the form of reimbursement for expenses incurred in getting to and presenting at the conference. These expenses can include:

- Flights or other transport to Melbourne
- Accommodation costs
- Other costs associated with attending such as a support worker, child care or a substitute teacher.

Please ask only for what you need in order to be able to present at the conference and highlight any opportunities you would use to save costs, such as finding cheaper accommodation further from the city (public transport provides easy access to the venue).

## Application

To apply for financial aid please fill out the application form linked by the button below. Applications will be approved progressively so please apply early and your application may be approved early. If the budget has not been exhausted the application process will be reopened.

To ensure equal consideration, please submit your application by the **13th of July, 2025** [Anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).

Submissions received after this date may still be considered if there is additional available funding.

## Reimbursement process

If granted assistance, you will still be expected to organise and purchase travel and accommodation yourself and await reimbursement. You will be given a maximum amount of reimbursement based on the assistance you requested. Once assistance is granted, you can start making bookings and sending us your receipts.

If you have any questions about financial assistance please contact us at [contact@pycon.org.au](mailto:contact@pycon.org.au)

## Financial assistance for attendees

We are hoping to provide financial assistance for attendees who might otherwise find it difficult to attend. If we are able to provide it, attendee financial assistance would include either a free conference ticket (at the enthusiast level) or a conference ticket plus additional reimbursed expenses as described above.

Note that we will only be able to consider applications for attendee financial assistance if you are travelling from within Australia, or from a location in the Pacific/Oceania region that does not have a more appropriate local PyCon.

Our ability to provide this will depend entirely on how much [sponsorship](/sponsor/) we receive, and we will announce the availability financial assistance along with instructions on how to apply if and when we are able.
