# Travelling to PyCon AU 2025

For some folks, PyCon AU 2025 will be their first time in Melbourne. Welcome! For others, it might have been a few years so welcome back! Here are some advice for getting around town (and to the conference).

## Interstate & International travel

Book travel to Melbourne Tullamarine Airport (MEL). Melbourne also has a second airport, Avalon Airport (AVV), which is significantly further from the city and less well-served by public transport.

Both MEL and AVV are served by [SkyBus](https://www.skybus.com.au/), a shuttle bus service that runs regularly between airports and the city. Tickets can be purchased upon arrival but are cheaper ($40 return for an adult) if pre-booked online.

## Public transport

All Melbourne public transport uses [Myki](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/Myki) smartcards for ticketing (similar to the Opal, Go Card, SmartRider, and MetroCard systems in other cities). Myki is the only way to pay for public transport in Melbourne; you can't buy paper tickets on board or at stations.

You can purchase a Myki card at the airport, most train stations, and many convenience stores around town. The card costs $6 and needs to be topped up with money for travel.

### Trams

Melbourne has an extensive and easy to use tram network. Travel is free inside [the Free Tram Zone](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PDFs/Maps/Network-maps/5b4a3efe80/PTV-Free-Tram-Zone-Map.pdf) covering most of the CBD, but you need to 'tap on' with your Myki if travelling outside the green zone.

### Trains

Train fares in Melbourne also use the Myki system. The closest train station to the conference venue is Jolimont-MCG, which is served by the Hurstbridge and Mernda lines.

# Arriving at PyCon AU 2025

This year's conference is held in the Grand Ballroom at Pullman Melbourne on the Park, 192 Wellington Parade, East Melbourne VIC 3002.

[Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EsouwJzKWC7jRGMK7)

The Grand Ballroom is located on the 1st floor, accessible from the main entrance on Wellington Parade. Stairs or elevators can be taken to the first floor, where all conference vents are taking place.


## via Tram

Routes **48 or 75**, alight at Stop 11 Jolimont Station-MCG. **This stop is outside the Free Tram Zone**, so you'll either need to touch on your Myki, or alight at stop 8 Spring St/Flinders St (route 75) or stop 8 Spring St/Collins St (route 48) and walk 10-15 minutes along Wellington Parade.

## via Train

If arriving by train, alight at Jolimont-MCG and exit to Wellington Parade, Pullman Melbourne on the Park will be across the road to your left.

## via Car or Ride share

Ride share can drop you at the Pullman Melbourne on the Park main entrance.

Parking is available, see the [Pullman Melbourne on the Park website for rates](https://www.pullmanonthepark.com.au/location-parking)
