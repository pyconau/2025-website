# Attending PyCon AU as an International Visitor
PyCon AU is an event that welcomes international visitors, including speakers, attendees, and exhibitors. If you are planning to attend PyCon AU from outside Australia, you will need to apply for a visa to enter the country.

We are registered with the International Event Coordinator Network (IECN) of the Department of Home Affairs.

The following information is provided to assist you in understanding the visa options available for attending PyCon AU. Please note that this information is general in nature and may not cover all individual circumstances. It is recommended that you consult the official website of the Department of Home Affairs or seek professional advice for your specific situation.

## How PyCon AU can assist

### International speakers
If your talk has been accepted to PyCon AU, you will be sent a speaker registration voucher to register your ticket. At the same time, the conference can provide a letter of support to assist with your visa application. This letter will confirm your participation as a speaker and provide details about the event.

We also recommend speakers apply for their visa as soon as possible after receiving the letter of support, as visa processing times can vary.

_PyCon AU cannot guarantee that you will be granted a visa_, but we hope the letter of invitation supports your application.

### International attendees
If you are registering to attend PyCon AU, you can indicate during registration that you will be attending from outside Australia. The details you provide are then shared with the Department of Home Affairs (via our IECN participation).

_PyCon AU cannot guarantee that you will be granted a visa_, but we hope this process assists with your application.

## Visa Application Process and Processing Times
 
Visa applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and actual processing times can vary due to individual circumstances including:
* whether the applicant has lodged a complete application, including all necessary supporting documents and paid associated visa application charges
* how promptly the applicant responds to any requests for additional information
* how long it takes to perform required checks on the supporting information provided
* how long it takes to receive information from external agencies, particularly in relation to health, character, and national security requirements
* when the application is lodged taking the current global visa processing times into account

Processing times are impacted each month by cases that are complex, changes to volume of applications and changes to Ministerial Directions.  More information about visa processing times please see: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-processing-times/overview.  For this reason, we would advise that visa applications be lodged at least 6 to 8 weeks prior to a person’s intended date of travel.
 
_**NB: IECN assistance will NOT guarantee a visa grant. Visa applicants must demonstrate that they meet all the legislative requirements for an Australian visa.**_

**NB**: In accordance with Australia's Privacy Act 1988, any information an event organiser or participant provides to the IECN will only be used to facilitate visa processing with the relevant Australian visa office overseas.
