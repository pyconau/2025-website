How can we move past cliches and buzzwords to use technology for good? This might mean volunteer-run, self-hosted open-source services for community groups and non-profits; organising regular sprints for open projects; or simply, supporting existing meetups and their organisers to secure venues, speakers, pizza sponsors and podcast rooms. Or perhaps, facilitate match-making and discovery for techies to provide tech help to public, mentor regional youth or deliver a workshop in their local library.

These are the kind of initiatives we are here to empower, incubate and if necessary initiate. Drop by at our **BoF** or the next **Touch Point**, to learn more and take part!
