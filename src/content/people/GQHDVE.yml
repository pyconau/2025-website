bio: <p>Benno is widely known as someone with opinions and a (possibly over-)willingness
  to share them. He has been working with computers professionally for over 30 years
  (unprofessionally for longer) and takes particular joy in examining how computers,
  the Internet, and all that surrounds all of these intersects with the humanity that
  it is meant to help.</p>
