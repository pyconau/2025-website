bio: "<p>I am a machine learning leader, technologist, and mum who moved from Oregon
  to Melbourne in 2010 and never looked back. I started in academia with a PhD in
  ML (plus a side of ecoinformatics), wrangled data for environmental science, then
  shifted to industry for real-world impact.</p>\n<p>I’ve led teams at Zendesk (hi,
  Answer Bot 👋), Culture Amp and now I’m Head of AI at Hatch, where we’re using data
  and design to help people find work they actually want. My work lives at the intersection
  of ethics, equity, and AI—and I care deeply about the long-term social impact of
  the systems we build. It's never “just tech”—it’s about power, access, and the messy
  human stuff behind the algorithms.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I’ve juggled research,
  parenting, imposter syndrome, and the occasional chicken. What keeps me grounded?
  Gardening, gaming, and mentoring folks who don’t always see themselves in tech—yet.</p>"
