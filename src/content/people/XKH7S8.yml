bio: <p>I am a 3rd year PhD candidate at Deakin University, specialising Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) for time series data analysis from heterogeneous IoT sensors.
  My research focuses on developing novel AI methods to classify time series measurements
  and recover the lost identity (metadata) of IoT sensors. I am passionate about building
  robust, intelligent systems that make sense of complex sensor data in real-world
  environments. I have been working with Python for over six years and regularly apply
  it to machine learning, data processing, and scientific research tasks.</p>
