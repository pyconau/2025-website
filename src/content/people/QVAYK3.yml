bio: "<p>Dr Duy Nguyen is a computational modeller and currently an Environmental
  Scientist in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO\">CSIRO</a> <a href=\"\
  https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/environment\">Environment Research
  Unit</a>, with expertise in fluid dynamics and turbulence modelling, particularly
  in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and airâ€“sea interactions. His research spans stratified
  flows, turbulence processes, physical oceanography, and marine atmospheric boundary
  layers. More recently, his work has focused on water quality modelling to support
  management of inland waters and provide early warning of harmful events, including
  fish kills, blackwater, algal blooms, and sediment transport, using a combination
  of process-based and data-driven approaches.</p>\n<p>At CSIRO, Duy is the Lead of
  the Water Quality Modelling Package at the <a href=\"https://research.csiro.au/aquawatch/about/\"\
  >CSIRO AquaWatch Program</a> and the <a href=\"https://research.csiro.au/dwl/\"
  >Digital Water &amp; Landscapes Program</a>, where the team integrates process-based,
  AI/ML, and large data streams from remote sensing to model and forecast water quality
  and quantity. His goal is to provide effective, science-informed solutions to address
  pressing water security challenges in Australia and beyond. Duy also leads the Vietnam
  AquaWatch pilot, where the team is building a monitoring and forecasting water quality
  system for the inland aquaculture. He has won several national and international
  awards from universities and governments in research, teaching, and education, as
  well as in services and social engagements.</p>"
