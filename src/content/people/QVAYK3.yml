  >CSIRO</a> <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/environment\"\
  >Environment Research Unit</a>, with expertise in <strong>Environmental Fluid Dynamics,
  turbulence modelling, numerical methods, and water quality modelling</strong>. His
  research involves hydrodynamic and water quality modelling of oceans, lakes, and
  rivers, combined with emerging satellite and hyperspectral and multispectral imagery
  technologies, and in situ and remote sensing of water quantity and quality. Duy
  is also a key model developer at the <strong>CSIRO AquaWatch Program</strong> and
  the <strong>Digital Water &amp; Landscapes Program</strong>, where he integrates
  process-based, AI/ML, and large data streams from remote sensing to model and forecast
  water quality and quantity. Duy leads the Vietnam AquaWatch pilot, where the team
  is building a monitoring and forecasting water quality system for the inland aquaculture.</p>\n
  <p>Duy is serving as chair of several associations, including the CSIRO Australia
  National Early Research Career Committee, the Group on Earth Observation AquaWatch
  Early Career Society, and was a committee member of the Early-Mid Career Research
  at the Australasian Fluid Mechanics Society. Duy has won several awards from universities
  and governments, including in research, teaching, and education, as well as in services
  and social engagements.</p>"
