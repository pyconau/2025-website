  be powered by AI solutions that deliver real life business benefits. I have deep
  expertise in solving complex computer vision and image-based AI problems, with hands-on
  experience applying cutting-edge research to real-world challenges. I was the lead

  prototype for coral restoration.</p>\n<p>In addition to my professional pursuits,
  I actively contribute to the tech community as a guest speaker at the National University

  technical blogs, speaking at industry conferences, and engaging in meaningful discussions
  around data and AI.</p>\n<p>I’m also deeply committed to women’s empowerment in
  technology. As the Singapore Ambassador for Women in Data Science (WiDS), I had
  the privilege of hosting a highly successful event in May 2023, bringing together
  100+ women in collaboration with Dataiku, Snowflake, and AWS. I also participate
