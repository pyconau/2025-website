bio: "<p>Sarah has been programming since before most PyCon AU-ers were  born (and
  since before many universities even owned a computer!). Having developed for macOS
  and the web for many years she has built everything from fermentation monitoring
  devices to furniture visualisers, but over the decades has never lost the thrill
  of being able to make a computer do what she wants.</p>\n<p>While she might not
  consider herself a teacher, she has literally written the book on macOS development
  for macOS newbies (well, four books actually). \nSarah's passion is trying to get
  more people writing apps for the Mac itself, so her latest book \"Escape from Tutorial
  Hell\" helps people get over that next hurdle from beginner-coder to developer-in-your-own-right.</p>\n
  <p>Sarah just can't get enough of computers, so in her spare time you'll either
  find her playing World of Warcraft or putting Python to work to solve Advent of
  Code problems.</p>"
