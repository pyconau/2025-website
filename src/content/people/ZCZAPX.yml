bio: "<p>Edwin began teaching IT in the Senior Secondary Sector of the ACT in 2014.
  Since then he has used a variety of languages and platforms for delivery, from Basic,
  to C# and most recently Python. Starting at Gungahlin College in 2014 and overseeing
  the school's IT program when it had the highest number of IT enrolments of any secondary
  college in the ACT, he now works at Burgmann Anglican School and continues his emphasis
  on student led, project based learning.</p>\n<p>Edwin manages multiple workshops
  throughout the year to help support local schools' education of IT, provide students
  with industry connections, and allow local industries to see what the students are
  capable of. He believes that IT is an incredible tool that can be combined with
  a variety of passions to create unique and world changing projects. If all students
  are taught IT foundations, in addition to the problem solving skills and knowledge
  theyâ€™ll acquire, it will open a range of possibilities that they may never have
  thought of.</p>"
