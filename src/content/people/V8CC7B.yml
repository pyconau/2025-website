bio: <p>Hi! I'm Sam, a student at UTS doing IT. I've been writing Python about five
  years fewer than I've been writing English, but it took most of that time to figure
  out how classes work. I spend most of my free time bouldering, at scouts, tinkering
  with elderly laptops, and coding python. This is my fourth time speaking at PyconAU,
  thanks to the student showcase.</p>
