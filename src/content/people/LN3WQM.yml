bio: "<p>After changing gears from corporate technology to tech education 1 year ago,
  I have been inspired and delighted watching my students grow. I work for the Canada
  Bay Council libraries, predominantly running The Lab, but also assisting in the
  makerspace and other tech education activities. \nMy 7 years as a front-end engineer
  at Nine and then Atlassian provided me with a solid foundation of technical expertise,
  that I still use today in my work as a developer for Kumo Study, a startup that
  creates study tools for people with ADHD. This goes hand-in-hand with my work with
  neurodivergent teenagers.\nI love teaching technology, and am excited to further
  improve my skills and the programs I teach so that every student feels empowered
  to learn and use it.\nPython was the first programming language I learnt, and so
  I always use it as the first step when teaching programming to my students.</p>"
