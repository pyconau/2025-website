bio: "<p>As CTO of Kumo Study – a study and productivity management tool for people
  with ADHD – and with plenty of varied consulting under my belt, I have a focus on
  how tech can help other fields progress. I firmly believe that every topic in the
  world has something interesting about it, and love to try and discover what that
  is. I love to learn what the problems are and how I can actually make an impact,
  ideally with as simple a program as possible.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using Python for
  years, working in both the professional and education sectors, and have focused
  on bringing the power of Python to everyone.</p>"
